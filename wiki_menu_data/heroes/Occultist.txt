Contents 1 Combat Skills 2 Camping Skills 3 Equipment 4 District Bonus 5 Trivia Combat Skills “ A lifetime of scholarly inquest into ancient and forbidden lore has opened the Occultist's mind to the powers of the void. Debilitating curses and maddeningly impossible support skills are his specialty. The void, however, is an unpredictable power, and consequently skills effectiveness can vary dramatically, and usually come at a cost of light, or stress. „ ~ Guild Note: New Occultists will always come with the Wyrd Reconstruction skill.

Such efforts are frequently taxing, however, exacting a toll in darkness and stress . „ ~ Survivalist Camping skills are special skills heroes can use while they are camping . They take a certain number of "respite" points to use, and can only be used once per camp (unless the skill says otherwise). Most heroes have three shared camping skills and all heroes have 4 unique camping skills (with the Flagellant being the exception, having only unique camping skills). Only 4 of these can be equipped at one time. Any Buffs or lasting effects given from a camping skill lasts for 4 battles. All of the Occultist's rites and rituals during camp will cause stress — if not to himself, then the others who are unnerved by it. But with effects that buff damage, heal a great amount of his own stress, prevent the Night-Time Ambush , and even remove mortality debuffs , they may be worth the risk.

"I know a rite for this. It will calm you." Equipment “ Scholarly robes, better suited to the library than the harsh realities of adventuring, are all the Occultist has brought with him. His rituals and chants require deft movements of hand and finger, so better he be unencumbered that he may channel the power of his morbid fetish: the polished skull of a dead man. „ ~ Blacksmith Equipment upgrades are all bought at the Blacksmith .

The Occultist has seven; 2 common, 2 Crimson Court and 1 uncommon, rare and very rare. In the base game, his lower level trinkets are incense and his high level trinkets are cauldrons. The Crimson Court DLC adds a vial of sand and tentacle idol, likely both symbols of the pact he struck. The Crimson Court DLC added special Trinket Sets, two for each hero. They confer powerful bonuses to the hero equipped with them, and having both equipped at once yields an additional bonus, which is shown greyed out at the bottom. The origin dungeon for all Trinket Sets is the Courtyard and they all have the rarity Crimson Court . The Shieldbreaker Trinket Set , however, is only obtainable through her final 6th and 7th nightmare encounters and won't be dropped or given as a reward in the Courtyard. Trinkets you already have will stop dropping, so there's value in not selling the ones you don't like until you get the ones you want. The Color of Madness DLC added trinkets with a new rarity, Crystalline . Each hero has their own unique crystalline trinket which can be bought from Jeweler inside the Nomad Wagon with Crystal Shards found within the Farmstead . District Bonus The Crimson Court DLC adds Districts to the Hamlet , some of which confer passive buffs to heroes.

Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos. Some can be translated but most seems to be made up by the devs. There is a partial translation here . He is a reference of the Lovecraft's character Abdul Alhazred also known as "the mad arab" , phantomatic writer of the Necronomicon. In fact, Alhazred is the Occultist's pregenerated name. He is the only hero to have both a combat skill to clear corpses and a camping skill to prevent nighttime ambushes. Given his bark while performing Wound Care while camping, he attended a liberal arts university. Given his "final" bark and some of the lines he uses when being on Death's Door/Afflicted, it can be assumed he has made a pact with an eldritch entity in order to gain his dark powers, and that this entity is at the same time pleased with the pact and angered by it (it speaks through him and orders his destruction to be free, and at the same time orders that no one touches him because they have a pact). His comic implies that what he sealed within himself has been passed down for a long time to multiple people. Spoilers If you take him to the final Darkest Dungeon quest , it becomes clear that the final boss has been tormenting him directly. However the sequel game clarifies that his pact creature, the black-beast, is not the same entity; he is simply assailed by eldritch forces in general, in addition to the black-beast's presence. view Heroes in Darkest Dungeon Heroes Abomination Antiquarian Arbalest Bounty Hunter Crusader Grave Robber Hellion Highwayman Houndmaster Jester Leper Man-at-Arms Occultist Plague Doctor Vestal DLC Flagellant Musketeer Shieldbreaker
