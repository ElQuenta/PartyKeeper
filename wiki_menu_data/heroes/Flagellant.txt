Flagellant has one of the strongest bleeds and healing skills especially while he's at low health. He is placed in ranks 1-2 where he can use his attacks, but all his supporting skills can be used at any rank. Contents 1 Unique Attributes 2 Combat Skills 3 Camping Skills 4 Equipment 5 District Bonus 6 Trivia Unique Attributes He will refuse to embark with another Flagellant in the party, as "the burden of suffering cannot be shared." As his name suggests, he will only use the Penance Hall for Stress Relief. This will always heal 100 stress, or 90 if "The Town is Abuzz!" Town Event is active. He also cannot gain any negative Quirks that restrict him to other town activities for Stress Relief unless he interacts with certain curios that will give him them, i.e. Moonshine Barrel The only Affliction Flagellant can receive is Rapturous, which gives +25% DMG, +3 SPD, and -20 DODGE. While Rapturous, Flagellant will often randomly attack enemies, other party members, or even himself, among other effects. He can never obtain a Virtue, and will always become Rapturous upon reaching 100 stress. However, if he dies in the Farmstead , he will be Refracted instead. When Flagellant falls below 40% HP, he receives a buff for +20% DMG and +7% CRIT. He will also become able to use his emergency heal skills (Redeem and Exsanguinate) if they're enabled during the battle. When Flagellant reaches Death's Door , every other member of the party is healed for 10% of their max HP, and Flagellant obtains a buff for +5 ACC, +20% DMG, +2 SPD, and +20% Stun, Bleed, Blight, and Debuff Resist. Additionally, he will also never gain Death's Door Recovery debuffs. However, he will still get Recovery debuffs from Heart attacks . In total, if Flagellant is both at Death's Door and Rapturous , he receives a grand total of: +65% DMG, +7 CRT, +5 SPD, +20% Stun/Bleed/Blight/Debuff resistance, and a -20 DODGE. Should Flagellant die , he will stun (125% base) all enemies as his last act, and heal the remaining party members for 10 HP. Combat Skills “ The Flagellant belongs to an extremist faction within the church, and is generally regarded with a toxic mixture of fear, awe and disgust. The power he draws from martyrdom is as effective as it is unsettling - in one moment he is a fountain of healing renewal, and the next, a conduit of terrible wrath. His full potential is realized only on the brink of madness... or death. „ ~ Guild Note: New Flagellants will always come with the Punish skill. "Exhaustion" debuffs (From Exsanguinate and Redeem ) cannot be cleared by Medicinal Herbs. (All buffs and debuffs last for 3 rounds unless otherwise specified.)

Instead, he whips himself mercilessly - this is a man locked in perpetual battle with his own flesh and blood. „ ~ Survivalist Unlike other heroes, Flagellant only has unique camping skills , giving him a total of 4. All of his camping skills target himself, either healing his health, his stress, or even raising his stress to bring him to his Rapturous state faster.

Equipment “ The Flagellant relishes the scars and abrasions that cover his body - drawing incomprehensible resilience from the tearing of his own flesh. His flail, a particularly cruel and merciless weapon, drips with his enemies' blood... and his own. „ ~ Blacksmith Equipment upgrades are all bought at the Blacksmith .

Flagellant has seven; 2 uncommon, 2 Crimson Court and 1 common, rare and very rare. His normal trinkets are hoods and collars, and his Crimson Court trinkets are teeth and glass due to a beating he received from a drunken patron while begging for money. The Crimson Court DLC added special Trinket Sets, two for each hero. They confer powerful bonuses to the hero equipped with them, and having both equipped at once yields an additional bonus, which is shown greyed out at the bottom. The origin dungeon for all Trinket Sets is the Courtyard and they all have the rarity Crimson Court . The Shieldbreaker Trinket Set , however, is only obtainable through her final 6th and 7th nightmare encounters and won't be dropped or given as a reward in the Courtyard. Trinkets you already have will stop dropping, so there's value in not selling the ones you don't like until you get the ones you want. The Color of Madness DLC added trinkets with a new rarity, Crystalline . Each hero has their own unique crystalline trinket which can be bought from Jeweler inside the Nomad Wagon with Crystal Shards found within the Farmstead . District Bonus The Crimson Court DLC adds Districts to the Hamlet , some of which confer passive benefits to heroes. Districts Name Effect Cost Altar of Light Crusader , Vestal , and Flagellant receive: +10% Stun Resist +10% Healing Skills 5000 (100) 200 1 Trivia Flagellant shares his name with a Quirk that makes heroes only use the Penance Chamber for Stress Relief. Naturally, he can only relieve stress in the Penance Chamber. Moreover, the achievement for recruiting a Flagellant for the first time, "The Flesh is Willing", shares its name with an attack that the Necromancer uses during his boss fight. The predetermined name for Flagellant is Damian, which is most likely named after a saint of the same name who introduced flagellation to the Catholic Church. He is currently the only playable character to have a modified Death Blow resistance. Flagellant has an innate 73% passive chance to resist fatality while others have a 67% chance. No backer heroes exist within this class, because backer heroes are Kickstarter users suggestions before the original game was released; the other three are the Musketeer , the Antiquarian and the Shieldbreaker . The line "Blood for the burden! Bones for the Light!" is most likely a reference to followers of Khorne, the Chaos god of hate, rage, violence, and bloodshed from Warhammer and their battlecry; "Blood for the Blood God, skulls for the Skull Throne!" Flagellant himself may be a reference to Flagellants from Warhammer Fantasy, as both use "weaponized suffering," against their enemies. The Crimson Court trinket Chipped Tooth, together with the quote "We're all falling apart", may possibly be a reference to a scene from the film Fight Club, where a protagonist (who found release in abusing his body) is disturbed to see his loosened tooth fall out. His companion Tyler Durden then quips: "Hey, even the Mona Lisa is falling apart", prompting the hero to flick the tooth away. view Heroes in Darkest Dungeon Heroes Abomination Antiquarian Arbalest Bounty Hunter Crusader Grave Robber Hellion Highwayman Houndmaster Jester Leper Man-at-Arms Occultist Plague Doctor Vestal DLC Flagellant Musketeer Shieldbreaker view DLC for Darkest Dungeon Expansions The Crimson Court The Color of Madness The Butcher's Circus Heroes The Shieldbreaker The Musketeer
