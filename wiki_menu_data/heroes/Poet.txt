Defensively, the Leper is quite self-sufficient, capable of drawing enemy attention while boosting his own defences, and healing his own HP and Stress ; while most of his offensive skills are oriented around wrecking the enemy front line. While boasting some of the highest health and damage numbers in the game, the Leper also suffers from a number of weaknesses. Firstly, his huge damage potential is limited by his inability to target the back ranks, as well as a tendency to Blind himself when attacking. Secondly, he is very weak to being repositioned: most of his skills become unusable in the back ranks, and unlike other front-line heroes, he does not have an efficient way to move himself Forward . Lastly, he has very low Speed , meaning that he is often forced to react to enemy attacks instead of acting proactively. When building a party with the Leper, care must be taken to mitigate these weaknesses, or to place him in a role where they are less debilitating.

Trivia The Leper is one of the twelve Heroes returning from Darkest Dungeon , and one of the first nine Heroes to be available in the sequel. Of the nine heroes available since the start of the game, he is also the one that has received the least changes in his kit, with the only differences to his current version being how Chop, Hew and Break could not use to ignore without mastery. The Leper's default name, Baldwin, is a reference to King Baldwin IV of Jerusalem. Despite developing leprosy in childhood, Baldwin nevertheless managed to maintain the integrity of the crusader kingdom during an era of increasing strife and encroachment by Muslim forces under Saladin. The Leper's backstory is unique among the heroes in that he has already made peace with his past. This is reflected in his portrait at the Shrine of Reflection , where unlike the other heroes, he looks into the light with his head held high.
