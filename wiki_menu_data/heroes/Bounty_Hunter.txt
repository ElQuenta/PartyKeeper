Crit Buff Bonus +33% DMG vs Marked Religious No Provisions None “ The thrill of the hunt... The promise of payment... „ ~ The Ancestor Bounty Hunter is one of the playable Characters in Darkest Dungeon . He is a very flexible class and comes with a good mix of damage and utility with his stun , marking , and movement skills. His flexibility lets him hit nearly any point in the enemy formation from almost any position in the party. His strengths include the following: Rank Versatility: Has many attacks and skills that can work at ranks 3-1, especially from rank 3. High damage attack with extreme emphasis on conditional damages such as Marked targets and Human type foes. Has strong mix of crowd control abilities with his move skills while also stunning them ( Flashbang and Uppercut ) or even marking them ( Come Hither ). Strong synergy with other mark users, especially other bounty hunters. High Trap disarm chance, and average to decent stats across the board. As well as decent base damage. Access to Camping Skills such as Planned Takedown against Size 2 or larger foes. And low time cost camping skills such as This How We Do It and Tracking . However, he does have some weaknesses: Limited skills and moves at rank 4. (Can only use Mark for death and Flashbang for utility. And his only damage is from Come Hither and Caltrops ) Average accuracy for his melee attack skills and require trinkets or quirks to be effective to hit anything. Without conditional effects such as Marks or Stun , his damage is average when fighting against non-human type enemies ( Collect Bounty ), making him a moderately okay front liner at worst. Bad Disease resistance, making him likely to get diseases from attacks from monsters that give diseases e.g Swine Wretches , or contact the Crimson Curse from attacks like The Thirst . Because of his kit and rank flexibility, he can be placed in ranks 3-1 but most builds compositions place Bounty Hunter at rank 3-2 where most of his skills are available while an another front liner or a tank hero takes rank 1. Contents 1 Combat Skills 2 Camping Skills 3 Equipment 4 District Bonus 5 Trivia Combat Skills “ A brutally efficient single-target executioner and crowd control specialist. For the Bounty Hunter, planning is key - mark targets for bonus damage or look for opportunities to capitalize on a stunned foe. He can also wreak havoc on an enemy party's order using his grappling hook, flashbangs and powerful uppercut. „ ~ Guild Note: New Bounty Hunters will always come with the Collect Bounty skill.

He can take time to study his notes, bettering his odds against typical foes or even specifically 'big game'. Scouting ahead can increase a party's knowledge of lurking threats, while tracking increases the party's chance of maintaining the element of surprise. „ ~ Survivalist Camping skills are special skills heroes can use while they are camping . They take a certain number of "respite" points to use, and can only be used once per camp (unless the skill says otherwise). Most heroes have three shared camping skills and all heroes have 4 unique camping skills (with the Flagellant being the exception, having only unique camping skills). Only 4 of these can be equipped at one time. Any Buffs or lasting effects given from a camping skill lasts for 4 battles. During camp, the Bounty Hunter is able to buff his accuracy and crit chance or increase his damage against large enemies . He can also increase scouting chance and reduce the chance of the party being surprised .

"The odds seem to be in our favour." * This bonus also applies for enemies larger than size 2. Equipment “ The Bounty Hunter favors a hand-axe and grappling hook, a pairing that allows him to ensnare and execute his quarry with professional efficiency. His tough leather and scale armor grants decent protection, without sacrificing mobility. „ ~ Blacksmith Equipment upgrades are all bought at the Blacksmith .

The Bounty Hunter has seven; 2 common, 2 Crimson Court and 1 uncommon, rare and very rare. In the base game, his trinkets are either beast talons or helmets. The Crimson Court DLC adds a bag full of teeth and a list of people he is/was seeking revenge on, while the Color of Madness DLC adds a cursed mask. The Crimson Court DLC added special Trinket Sets, two for each hero. They confer powerful bonuses to the hero equipped with them, and having both equipped at once yields an additional bonus, which is shown greyed out at the bottom. The origin dungeon for all Trinket Sets is the Courtyard and they all have the rarity Crimson Court . The Shieldbreaker Trinket Set , however, is only obtainable through her final 6th and 7th nightmare encounters and won't be dropped or given as a reward in the Courtyard. Trinkets you already have will stop dropping, so there's value in not selling the ones you don't like until you get the ones you want. The Color of Madness DLC added trinkets with a new rarity, Crystalline . Each hero has their own unique crystalline trinket which can be bought from Jeweler inside the Nomad Wagon with Crystal Shards found within the Farmstead . District Bonus The Crimson Court DLC adds Districts to the Hamlet , some of which confer passive benefits to heroes. Districts Name Effect Cost House of the Yellow Hand Bounty Hunter , Grave Robber , and Highwayman receive: +4% CRIT +5% Scouting Chance 5000 (1000) 100 1 Trivia Three of his skills ( Finish Him, Come Hither & Uppercut ) are references to the Mortal Kombat series. His blue and green color palettes resemble the armor of Jango and Boba Fett - bounty hunters from "Star Wars" movies. The predetermined name of the Bounty Hunter is Tardif, a reference to Red Hook programmer Pierre Tardif. From the Bounty Hunter's Crimson Court item set (most notably the Vengeful Kill List) it can be inferred that the Bounty Hunter may also fight for revenge, not just money. There's a total of 21 " ... " barks for the Bounty Hunter, and 14 others are also completely wordless. His current Caltrops skill was formerly known as Hook and Slice , which, while functionally identical as a ranged skill that inflicts bleed, had a different range and position restriction. The PS Vita version of the game still retains Hook and Slice . The Bounty Hunter's full face is never truly revealed, but the lower half of his face can be seen in the promotional art for the Crimson Court DLC of Darkest Dungeon . view Heroes in Darkest Dungeon Heroes Abomination Antiquarian Arbalest Bounty Hunter Crusader Grave Robber Hellion Highwayman Houndmaster Jester Leper Man-at-Arms Occultist Plague Doctor Vestal DLC Flagellant Musketeer Shieldbreaker
