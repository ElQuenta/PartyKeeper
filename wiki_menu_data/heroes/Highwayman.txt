Crit Buff Bonus +2 SPD Religious No Provisions None “ Elusive, evasive, persistent - righteous traits for a rogue. „ ~ The Ancestor The Highwayman is one of the playable Characters in Darkest Dungeon . He is a strong, flexible damage dealer. A typical Highwayman build places him in ranks 2-4, utilizing his melee skills or Pistol Shot for damage. His very rare Trinket , the Gunslinger's Buckle , also enables a strong pure-ranged build ("Gunwayman"). Contents 1 Combat Skills 2 Camping Skills 3 Equipment 4 District Bonus 5 Trivia Combat Skills “ A rogue, a thug and a thief, the Highwayman has honed his skills with dirk and flintlock to devastating effect. Whether at range or in a melee, he is equally effective at dispatching his foes. Be it a grapeshot area-of-effect, or single target bleed, the Highwayman's skills focus solely on dealing damage in a variety of ways. „ ~ Guild Note: New Highwaymen will always come with the Pistol Shot skill. (All buffs and debuffs last for 3 rounds unless otherwise specified.)

Camping Skills “ The Highwayman relishes cynical preparedness and off-color jokes around the campfire. A life spent running and hiding has taught him the tenuous benefit of perimeter alarms, and late-night investigations into the encroaching shadows. „ ~ Survivalist Camping skills are special skills heroes can use while they are camping . They take a certain number of "respite" points to use, and can only be used once per camp (unless the skill says otherwise). Most heroes have three shared camping skills and all heroes have 4 unique camping skills (with the Flagellant being the exception, having only unique camping skills). Only 4 of these can be equipped at one time. Any Buffs or lasting effects given from a camping skill lasts for 4 battles. The Highwayman's unique camping skills are primarily self-focused, with powerful but costly buffs for either ranged or melee abilities, but he does have ambush prevention, and a chance to heal a significant amount of stress for the whole party.

His flintlock and short sword afford him great versatility; he is never out of position, or caught unawares. „ ~ Blacksmith Equipment upgrades are all bought at the Blacksmith .

The Highwayman has eight; 3 common, 2 Crimson Court and 1 uncommon, rare and very rare. In the base game, his trinkets are all either belt buckles, dagger sheathes or gunpowder. The Color of Madness DLC adds another gunpowder trinket, while The Crimson Court DLC adds a his neckerchief and a locket with a picture of the woman and child from his comic. The Crimson Court DLC added special Trinket Sets, two for each hero. They confer powerful bonuses to the hero equipped with them, and having both equipped at once yields an additional bonus, which is shown greyed out at the bottom. The origin dungeon for all Trinket Sets is the Courtyard and they all have the rarity Crimson Court . The Shieldbreaker Trinket Set , however, is only obtainable through her final 6th and 7th nightmare encounters and won't be dropped or given as a reward in the Courtyard. Trinkets you already have will stop dropping, so there's value in not selling the ones you don't like until you get the ones you want. The Color of Madness DLC added trinkets with a new rarity, Crystalline . Each hero has their own unique crystalline trinket which can be bought from Jeweler inside the Nomad Wagon with Crystal Shards found within the Farmstead . District Bonus The Crimson Court DLC adds Districts to the Hamlet , some of which confer passive benefits to heroes.

The Highwayman and the Grave Robber have many similarities with each other. They are also the only class that share a unique Camp Skill, that being Gallows Humor. In the comic covering his introduction, it's shown that he was originally one of the many Brigands preying on the roads leading to the Hamlet. In haste to bring down what he thought was an easy mark, he accidentally killed a woman and child who were taking shelter inside the carriage. Overcome with remorse, the Highwayman left his previous path behind and now adventures to make amends. Chris Bourassa has tweeted that they are not his wife and child, and that he was set up to rob the wrong coach. Another theory is that the Highwayman killed the crusader's wife and son, based on the similarities the woman and child share with the crusader's family. Chris Bourassa has tweeted that this theory is not true either. The Highwayman's set of skills are unique among the other heroes for two reasons. He is the only hero whose entire moveset deals damage, and he is the only hero who has no offensive skill without damage modification. This makes The Guild's statement true. Despite claiming he never misses, he actually misses enemy's eyes in another one of his lines when landing a critical. This, however, could be referencing him landing a headshot (which usually lands "between the eyes", hence he "missed" the eye with it). While most characters have seven trinkets, The Crusader , Highwayman , Plague Doctor , and Vestal all have the most at eight. Hinted at by one of his quotes when becoming hopeless or irrational, the Highwayman may have originally been a candlemaker. Hinted at by some of his quotes when becoming abusive, fearful, or hopeless, the Highwayman may speak Yiddish or the universe's counterpart, saying ' drek ' upon being hit and ' feh ' upon switching positions or becoming abusive. The Highwayman makes multiple references to literature when he becomes irrational, referencing Alice from Alice's Adventures in Wo nderland and Wiglaf from Beowulf . The Highwayman's mouth and chin are usually covered by his scarf in all circumstances, but his full face is revealed on promotional art for The Crimson Court DLC. His full face can also be seen in a story panel made for Darkest Dungeon II . view Heroes in Darkest Dungeon Heroes Abomination Antiquarian Arbalest Bounty Hunter Crusader Grave Robber Hellion Highwayman Houndmaster Jester Leper Man-at-Arms Occultist Plague Doctor Vestal DLC Flagellant Musketeer Shieldbreaker
