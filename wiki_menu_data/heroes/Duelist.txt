Due to many of her skills moving her forward or backwards throughout the ranks, Duelist can reposition herself with ease, making her incredibly difficult if not outright impossible to shuffle out of position. As a counterbalance to her various strengths and flexibility, Duelist has to manage a unique Stance system that plays into nearly every aspect of her character, with nearly all of her moves gaining new effects based on the stance she's in or requiring her to have a specific stance to use them. Additionally, Duelist has among the lowest health in the game and has very little ways to defend herself outside of Dodge , often relying on her teammates to protect her via Guarded , Taunt , or heals. The Duelist's excellent mobility can also occasionally cause teammates to be pushed out of position, and often requires teams to be built with her mobility in mind.
