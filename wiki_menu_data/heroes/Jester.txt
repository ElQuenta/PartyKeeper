Crit Buff Bonus +40% Stress Healing Skills Religious No Provisions Medicinal Herbs “ He will be laughing still... at the end. „ ~ The Ancestor The Jester is an offensive support hero in Darkest Dungeon . In the back ranks (or while camping) he can greatly buff the party's offensive capabilities and heal their stress , and in the front ranks he becomes one of the strongest DODGE tanks in the game . He can also inflict Bleed on the middle ranks. The Jester has high SPD, DODGE, and mobility, and fits well into dance parties. However, he has low HP, few ways to recover health, and his skills often move allies out of position—all of which should be accounted for when building a party. Contents 1 Combat Skills 1.1 Notes 2 Camping Skills 3 Equipment 4 District Bonus 5 Trivia Combat Skills “ Combat is a power ballad - a slow build up, and a grand finale! On the offense, the Jester leaps to and fro in a bloody cacophony, positioning himself for a glorious end in the front ranks! Alternatively, he can hang back, delivering chilling melodies and unsettling riffs that terrorize his foes, and give strength to his allies. „ ~ Guild Dirk Stab # Range Rank Target Damage Accuracy Crit mod Effect Self Melee +0% 85 5% Forward 1 Bypass Guard Finale : +30% DMG (8 rds) Further levels Level 2 +0% 90 6% Forward 1 Bypass Guard Finale : +30% DMG (8 rds) Level 3 +0% 95 7% Forward 1 Bypass Guard Finale : +30% DMG (8 rds) Level 4 +0% 100 8% Forward 1 Bypass Guard Finale : +30% DMG (8 rds) Level 5 +0% 105 9% Forward 1 Bypass Guard Finale : +30% DMG (8 rds) Sound Harvest # Range Rank Target Damage Accuracy Crit mod Effect Self Melee -50% 90 0% Bleed (100% base) 2 pts/rd for 3 rds Finale : +30% DMG (8 rds) Further levels Level 2 -50% 95 1% Bleed (110% base) 2 pts/rd for 3 rds Finale : +30% DMG (8 rds) Level 3 -50% 100 2% Bleed (120% base) 3 pts/rd for 3 rds Finale : +30% DMG (8 rds) Level 4 -50% 105 3% Bleed (130% base) 3 pts/rd for 3 rds Finale : +30% DMG (8 rds) Level 5 -50% 110 4% Bleed (140% base) 4 pts/rd for 3 rds Finale : +30% DMG (8 rds) Sound Finale # Range Rank Target Damage Accuracy Crit mod Effect Self Melee +50% 140 5% Back 3 -25 DODGE -3 SPD +100% Stress (1 Battle) Further levels Level 2 +50% 145 6% Back 3 -25 DODGE -3 SPD +100% Stress (1 Battle) Level 3 +50% 150 7% Back 3 -25 DODGE -3 SPD +100% Stress (1 Battle) Level 4 +50% 155 8% Back 3 -25 DODGE -3 SPD +100% Stress (1 Battle) Level 5 +50% 160 9% Back 3 -25 DODGE -3 SPD +100% Stress (1 Battle) Sound Limit: 1 Use per Battle Solo # Range Rank Target Damage Accuracy Crit mod Effect Self Ranged -100% 125 Forward 3 Mark Self (3 rds) +20 DODGE (4 rds) Finale : +75% DMG (8 rds) Finale : +8% CRIT (8 rds) Further levels Level 2 -100% 130 Forward 3 Mark Self (3 rds) +22 DODGE (4 rds) Finale : +75% DMG (8 rds) Finale : +8% CRIT (8 rds) Level 3 -100% 135 Forward 3 Mark Self (3 rds) +25 DODGE (4 rds) Finale : +75% DMG (8 rds) Finale : +8% CRIT (8 rds) Level 4 -100% 140 Forward 3 Mark Self (3 rds) +27 DODGE (4 rds) Finale : +75% DMG (8 rds) Finale : +8% CRIT (8 rds) Level 5 -100% 145 Forward 3 Mark Self (3 rds) +30 DODGE (4 rds) Finale : +75% DMG (8 rds) Finale : +8% CRIT (8 rds) Sound Limit: 2 Uses per Battle Slice Off # Range Rank Target Damage Accuracy Crit mod Effect Self Melee -33% 95 8% Bleed (100% base) 3 pts/rd for 3 rds Finale : +30% DMG (8 rds) Further levels Level 2 -33% 100 9% Bleed (110% base) 3 pts/rd for 3 rds Finale : +30% DMG (8 rds) Level 3 -33% 105 10% Bleed (120% base) 4 pts/rd for 3 rds Finale : +30% DMG (8 rds) Level 4 -33% 110 11% Bleed (130% base) 4 pts/rd for 3 rds Finale : +30% DMG (8 rds) Level 5 -33% 115 12% Bleed (140% base) 5 pts/rd for 3 rds Finale : +30% DMG (8 rds) Sound Battle Ballad # Rank Target Effect Self +5 ACC +2% CRIT +2 SPD (4 rds) Finale : +30% DMG (8 rds) Finale : +8% CRIT (8 rds) Further levels Level 2 +6 ACC +3% CRIT +2 SPD (4 rds) Finale : +30% DMG (8 rds) Finale : +8% CRIT (8 rds) Level 3 +7 ACC +4% CRIT +3 SPD (4 rds) Finale : +30% DMG Finale : +8% CRIT (8 rds) Level 4 +8 ACC +5% CRIT +3 SPD (4 rds) Finale : +30% DMG Finale : +8% CRIT (8 rds) Level 5 +10 ACC +6% CRIT +4 SPD (4 rds) Finale : +30% DMG Finale : +8% CRIT (8 rds) Sound Inspiring Tune # Rank Target Effect Self Stress -8 -10% Stress Finale : +30% DMG (8 rds) Finale : +8% CRIT (8 rds) Further levels Level 2 Stress -9 -12.5% Stress Finale : +30% DMG (8 rds) Finale : +8% CRIT (8 rds) Level 3 Stress -10 -15% Stress Finale : +30% DMG (8 rds) Finale : +8% CRIT (8 rds) Level 4 Stress -11 -17.5% Stress Finale : +30% DMG (8 rds) Finale : +8% CRIT (8 rds) Level 5 Stress -12 -20% Stress Finale : +30% DMG (8 rds) Finale : +8% CRIT (8 rds) Sound Notes All buffs and debuffs last for 3 rounds unless otherwise specified. Newly recruited Jesters will always have Harvest equipped. Self-debuffs (from Finale , for example) cannot be removed with Medicinal Herbs . Camping Skills “ The Jester shines in the flickering light of the campfire, bringing his lute and unerring wit to bear against the fears and stress his companions suffer. He can inspire greater combat prowess, or raise the group's spirits at the cost of singling out a target for his acrimonious scandalizing. „ ~ Survivalist Camping skills are special skills heroes can use while they are camping . They take a certain number of "respite" points to use, and can only be used once per camp (unless the skill says otherwise). Most heroes have three shared camping skills and all heroes have 4 unique camping skills (with the Flagellant being the exception, having only unique camping skills). Only 4 of these can be equipped at one time. Any Buffs or lasting effects given from a camping skill lasts for 4 battles. Jester is all fun and games at camp, singing songs and making jokes to keep everyone's stress levels down. However, sometimes he can go too far with a joke.

Only a fool would underestimate the vicious bloodletting power of his sharpened sickle, or the discordant throng of his lute. „ ~ Blacksmith Equipment upgrades are all bought at the Blacksmith .

Jester has seven; 2 common, 2 Crimson Court and 1 uncommon, rare and very rare. In the base game, his lower level trinkets are dice and his high level trinkets are tambourines. The Crimson Court DLC adds a necklace made from a finger bone and poisoned goblet, while the Color of Madness DLC adds a crystal filled lute. The Crimson Court DLC added special Trinket Sets, two for each hero. They confer powerful bonuses to the hero equipped with them, and having both equipped at once yields an additional bonus, which is shown greyed out at the bottom. The origin dungeon for all Trinket Sets is the Courtyard and they all have the rarity Crimson Court . The Shieldbreaker Trinket Set , however, is only obtainable through her final 6th and 7th nightmare encounters and won't be dropped or given as a reward in the Courtyard. Trinkets you already have will stop dropping, so there's value in not selling the ones you don't like until you get the ones you want. The Color of Madness DLC added trinkets with a new rarity, Crystalline . Each hero has their own unique crystalline trinket which can be bought from Jeweler inside the Nomad Wagon with Crystal Shards found within the Farmstead . District Bonus The Crimson Court DLC adds Districts to the Hamlet , some of which confer passive benefits to heroes.

He also quotes a verse from a song when he activates one of them. Jester's final weapon upgrade, Slash and Solo , is also a reference to Slash, the guitarist of Guns and Roses and his revered solos. The predetermined name of Jester is Sarmenti (formerly Jingles), a reference to Sarmentus, a jester mentioned in the Satires by the Roman poet Horace. The Crimson Court trinkets "Tyrant's Tasting Cup" and "Tyrant's Fingerbone" are references to his lore comic . Jester was employed in the court of an abusive tyrant, eventually coming to murder him and his entire court. Jester's lore may be a reference to the song "Duel of Jester and the Tyrant" by Chick Corea. Jester's Irrational barks consist almost entirely of laughter and random noises, the only exceptions being, "Off with his head! Ha-haaa!" and "HAAAAA! Not for me!" . The lick that Jester plays on his lute in Battle Ballad is similar to a lick from "The Devil Went Down To Georgia" by Charlie Daniels. When Jester walks, faint jingling can be heard from his outfit's bells, making him the only character to have a unique walking sound. view Heroes in Darkest Dungeon Heroes Abomination Antiquarian Arbalest Bounty Hunter Crusader Grave Robber Hellion Highwayman Houndmaster Jester Leper Man-at-Arms Occultist Plague Doctor Vestal DLC Flagellant Musketeer Shieldbreaker
