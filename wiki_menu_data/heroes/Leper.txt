Crit Buff Bonus +10 ACC Religious Yes Provisions Medicinal Herbs “ This man understands that adversity and existence are one and the same. „ ~ The Ancestor The Leper is one of the strongest front-line tank/support heroes in Darkest Dungeon , with skills and attributes that greatly boost the team's survivability . He is extremely resilient, having the highest HP of all heroes and capable of drawing enemy attacks with Mark , boosting his own defences, and healing his own HP and Stress . Likewise his support skills disable dangerous enemies, including bosses, by greatly debuffing their SPD and DMG, or by forcing them out of position. Generally speaking, the stronger the enemy, the more useful the Leper also becomes. He is so strong that he can even solo many boss expeditions! Offensively, the Leper also can also be powerful, but with major drawbacks. While he has the highest base damage of all heroes, he also has poor reach, notoriously low ACC, and very low SPD. And as a strictly front-line hero, he is very vulnerable to being shuffled out of position.

The Leper is most effective when given a turn to focus himself before raising his massive blade. When he swings, it is all or nothing - crushing blows and massive damage or the empty whistling of a glancing blow. He is entirely self-sufficient, drawing strength from his life of trauma, and able to channel it into healing, protection, or unrelenting fury. „ ~ Guild Chop # Range Rank Target Damage Accuracy Crit mod Effect Self Melee +0% 75 3% Further levels Level 2 +0% 80 4% Level 3 +0% 85 5% Level 4 +0% 90 6% Level 5 +0% 95 7% Sound Hew # Range Rank Target Damage Accuracy Crit mod Effect Self Melee -50% 75 -4% Further levels Level 2 -50% 80 -3% Level 3 -50% 85 -2% Level 4 -50% 90 -1% Level 5 -50% 95 0% Sound Purge # Range Rank Target Damage Accuracy Crit mod Effect Self Melee -40% 85 0% Knockback 3 (100% base) Clear all Corpses +5 ACC (4 rds) Further levels Level 2 -40% 90 1% Knockback 3 (110% base) Clear all Corpses +5 ACC (4 rds) Level 3 -40% 95 2% Knockback 3 (120% base) Clear all Corpses +5 ACC (4 rds) Level 4 -40% 100 3% Knockback 3 (130% base) Clear all Corpses +5 ACC (4 rds) Level 5 -40% 105 4% Knockback 3 (140% base) Clear all Corpses +5 ACC (4 rds) Sound Revenge # Rank Target Effect Self Self +10 ACC / +25% DMG / +7% CRIT -10 DODGE / +25% DMG Taken (1 Battle) Further levels Level 2 +11 ACC / +27% DMG / +8% CRIT -10 DODGE / +25% DMG Taken (1 Battle) Level 3 +12 ACC / +30% DMG / +9% CRIT -10 DODGE / +25% DMG Taken (1 Battle) Level 4 +13 ACC / +32% DMG / +10% CRIT -10 DODGE / +25% DMG Taken (1 Battle) Level 5 +15 ACC / +35% DMG / +11% CRIT -10 DODGE / +25% DMG Taken (1 Battle) Sound Limit: 1 Use per Battle Withstand # Rank Target Effect Self Self Mark Self / +20% PROT +30% Blight , Bleed , Debuff , Move Resist (1 Battle) Further levels Level 2 Mark Self / +22% PROT +30% Blight , Bleed , Debuff , Move Resist (1 Battle) Level 3 Mark Self / +25% PROT +30% Blight , Bleed , Debuff , Move Resist (1 Battle) Level 4 Mark Self / +27% PROT +30% Blight , Bleed , Debuff , Move Resist (1 Battle) Level 5 Mark Self / +30% PROT +30% Blight , Bleed , Debuff , Move Resist (1 Battle) Sound Limit: 1 Use per Battle Solemnity # Rank Target Heal Effect Self Self 6 Stress -5 Further levels Level 2 7 Stress -5 Level 3 8 Stress -6 Level 4 9 Stress -6 Level 5 10 Stress -7 Sound Intimidate # Range Rank Target Damage Accuracy Crit mod Effect Self Melee -85% 95 0% Bypass/Remove Stealth -20% DMG (100% base) -3 SPD (100% base) (3 rds) Mark Self +2 SPD (4 rds) Further levels Level 2 -85% 100 0% Bypass/Remove Stealth -23% DMG (110% base) -3 SPD (110% base) (3 rds) Mark Self +2 SPD (4 rds) Level 3 -85% 105 0% Bypass/Remove Stealth -26% DMG (120% base) -4 SPD (120% base) (3 rds) Mark Self +3 SPD (4 rds) Level 4 -80% 110 0% Bypass/Remove Stealth -29% DMG (130% base) -4 SPD (130% base) (3 rds) Mark Self +3 SPD (4 rds) Level 5 -80% 115 0% Bypass/Remove Stealth -33% DMG (140% base) -5 SPD (140% base) (3 rds) Mark Self +4 SPD (4 rds) Sound Notes All buffs and debuffs last for 3 rounds unless otherwise specified. Newly recruited Lepers will always have Chop equipped. Self-debuffs (from Revenge , for example) cannot be removed with Medicinal Herbs . Camping Skills “ A loner and an outcast, the Leper will tend to shun the others in his group, preferring instead to mend his own dying body at the expense of the horror such an undertaking brings forth. In order to reduce his stress, the Leper can remove his mask, but such a thing is sure to unsettle his companions. „ ~ Survivalist Camping skills are special skills heroes can use while they are camping . They take a certain number of "respite" points to use, and can only be used once per camp (unless the skill says otherwise). Most heroes have three shared camping skills and all heroes have 4 unique camping skills (with the Flagellant being the exception, having only unique camping skills). Only 4 of these can be equipped at one time. Any Buffs or lasting effects given from a camping skill lasts for 4 battles. The Leper is a self-reliant man, and as such he takes care of himself while he prepares for tomorrow's campaign. He can buff himself and heal his stress, but the Leper's means of relief may disturb his companions. He can also heal the stress of others by isolating himself from them, but that puts strain on his body.

The Leper has seven; 2 common, 2 Crimson Court and 1 uncommon, rare and very rare. In the base game, his lower level trinkets are armlets and his high level trinkets are masks. The Crimson Court DLC adds a flute along with his last will. The Crimson Court DLC added special Trinket Sets, two for each hero. They confer powerful bonuses to the hero equipped with them, and having both equipped at once yields an additional bonus, which is shown greyed out at the bottom. The origin dungeon for all Trinket Sets is the Courtyard and they all have the rarity Crimson Court . The Shieldbreaker Trinket Set , however, is only obtainable through her final 6th and 7th nightmare encounters and won't be dropped or given as a reward in the Courtyard. Trinkets you already have will stop dropping, so there's value in not selling the ones you don't like until you get the ones you want. The Color of Madness DLC added trinkets with a new rarity, Crystalline . Each hero has their own unique crystalline trinket which can be bought from Jeweler inside the Nomad Wagon with Crystal Shards found within the Farmstead . District Bonus Outsiders Bonfire 2 additional Respite Points if you have at least one Abomination , Hellion or Leper in your party. Note: the stated bonus is granted as long as the party contains at least one hero that meets the criteria; the party will not receive extra respite points for bringing more such heroes. 1000 (1000) 300 1 Trivia The Leper has inspirations taken from Baldwin IV of Jerusalem, the crusader king who was also known as "The Leper" or "The Leper King." The Leper's metal mask and headdress are particularly reminiscent of those worn by King Baldwin in Ridley Scott's 2005 film Kingdom of Heaven. In fact, one of the pregenerated names for the Leper is Baldwin. The line of his Crimson Court set "The last treasures of a king," as well as his barks betraying the manner of an aristocrat, only reinforce the reference. However, the masked appearance of Baldwin in the film is a fiction that has no basis in the historical record. Some of his barks ("I was a soldier," referring to "pincer movement" and "watching the flanks," disdainfully asking if one has military training) also show that the Leper successfully fought in an organized military before the events of the game, another thing that Baldwin IV was known for doing despite his affliction. Unlike the crusader king though, the Leper is given a personality of a war poet, his speech replete with dark and colourful metaphors and philosophical musings on his approaching death. One of his barks upon becoming irrational (" Where what blade throne calls under winter." ) is likely a reference to the A Song of Ice and Fire series and its TV adaption Game of Thrones , where a focal plot point is the Iron Throne, forged out of swords melted together, and in a setting where winter is a prevalent and significant threat. view Heroes in Darkest Dungeon Heroes Abomination Antiquarian Arbalest Bounty Hunter Crusader Grave Robber Hellion Highwayman Houndmaster Jester Leper Man-at-Arms Occultist Plague Doctor Vestal DLC Flagellant Musketeer Shieldbreaker
