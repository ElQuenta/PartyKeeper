Crit Buff Bonus -33% Stress Religious No Provisions None “ The raw strength of youth may be spent, but his eyes hold the secrets of a hundred campaigns. „ ~ The Ancestor Man-at-Arms is one of the playable Characters in Darkest Dungeon . He has a defensive/support skillset that mitigates a lot of risk, enabling his teammates to focus on damage or more generally to use strategies that they may not be able to safely do otherwise. His strengths include: Team survivability: not only does Man-at-Arms have one of the highest health pools in the game, but he also has a Guard skill that redirects damage towards himself while significantly boosting his own survivability. Strong buffs and debuffs that significantly boost the team's offensive and defensive stats. Notably, Man-at-Arms is a good candidate for a DODGE-based party, since his buffs can grant +20 DODGE to the entire team. Decent Reach: Can hit rank 3. Rampart has a (potentially) very high stun chance and, with its movement and Man-at-Arms' low speed, allows him to be a good dancing partner for faster heroes. Some of the best camping buffs in the game. His primary weakness is awful SPD. His buffs, debuffs, guard, and other skills all require high SPD to be effective, but Man-at-Arms has one of the lowest base SPD values amongst all heroes. Man-at-Arms is typically run as a support/tank in ranks 1-2. He can function in rank 3 in dancing parties, or rarely, in rank 4 as a pure support.

Immovable, commanding, and focused, the Man-at-Arms breaks down enemy lines with his mace, buckler, and furious battle cries. „ ~ Guild Note: New Men-at-Arms will always come with the Crush skill.

Camping Skills “ The Man-at-Arms seeks to either practice his strict training regimen himself, or teach it to his companions. Dexterity, damage and unerring accuracy await those fortified enough to endure his lessons. „ ~ Survivalist Camping skills are special skills heroes can use while they are camping . They take a certain number of "respite" points to use, and can only be used once per camp (unless the skill says otherwise). Most heroes have three shared camping skills and all heroes have 4 unique camping skills (with the Flagellant being the exception, having only unique camping skills). Only 4 of these can be equipped at one time. Any Buffs or lasting effects given from a camping skill lasts for 4 battles. Being a military veteran, the Man-at-Arms makes sure that training isn't overlooked even when resting. He can buff himself, one other hero, or even the entire party for almost any stat, including DODGE, CRIT, ACC, and DMG.

Man-at-Arms has seven; 2 common, 2 Crimson Court and 1 uncommon, rare and very rare. In the base game, his lower level trinkets are eye-patches and his high level trinkets are shields. The Crimson Court DLC adds a banner and toy soldier. The Crimson Court DLC added special Trinket Sets, two for each hero. They confer powerful bonuses to the hero equipped with them, and having both equipped at once yields an additional bonus, which is shown greyed out at the bottom. The origin dungeon for all Trinket Sets is the Courtyard and they all have the rarity Crimson Court . The Shieldbreaker Trinket Set , however, is only obtainable through her final 6th and 7th nightmare encounters and won't be dropped or given as a reward in the Courtyard. Trinkets you already have will stop dropping, so there's value in not selling the ones you don't like until you get the ones you want. The Color of Madness DLC added trinkets with a new rarity, Crystalline . Each hero has their own unique crystalline trinket which can be bought from Jeweler inside the Nomad Wagon with Crystal Shards found within the Farmstead . District Bonus The Crimson Court DLC adds Districts to the Hamlet , some of which confer passive benefits to heroes.

Man-at-Arms' Mace's round head and spikes qualify it more specifically as a morning-star. Man-at-Arms introduced two new mechanics to the game when he was added: guarding and ripostes. The predetermined name of Man-at-Arms is Barristan, a reference to Barristan the Bold, a character from the book series A Song of Ice and Fire. Barristan the Bold is a famed knight, now well past his glory days, and sometimes called Barristan the Old, similar to how the Man-at-Arms is past his glory days. The guild text refers to Man-at-Arms' shield as a buckler, but it is actually a heater shield. The level 3 mace and plated mail are named "Sergeant Major's" while the level 4 ones are named "Master Sergeant's", despite Sergeant Major being a higher rank in real life than Master Sergeant. One of Man-at-Arms' names is 'Pipin'. This could be a reference to the Berserk character of the same name. Another possible name is 'Chatwood'. This is likely after Stuart Chatwood, composer of Darkest Dungeon's soundtrack. view Heroes in Darkest Dungeon Heroes Abomination Antiquarian Arbalest Bounty Hunter Crusader Grave Robber Hellion Highwayman Houndmaster Jester Leper Man-at-Arms Occultist Plague Doctor Vestal DLC Flagellant Musketeer Shieldbreaker
