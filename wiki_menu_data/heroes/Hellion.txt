Contents 1 Combat Skills 2 Camping Skills 3 Equipment 4 District Bonus 5 Trivia Combat Skills “ Wild, unpredictable, and utterly ruthless, the Hellion thrills to the spilling of blood! Her massive glaive affords her impressive reach in combat, while its razor sharp edge leaves lasting wounds on enemies. Versatile and unrelenting, she can hit the back row with her blade and devastate her foes. Certain skills leave her exhausted, however, and she may occasionally need to take a turn to recharge her adrenaline before entering the fray once again. „ ~ Guild Note: New Hellions will always come with the Wicked Hack skill. "Exhaustion" debuffs (From Barbaric Yawp , Breakthrough , and Bleed Out ) cannot be cleared by Medicinal Herbs, but can easily be made up by using Adrenaline Rush to recharge the Hellion’s stats. (All buffs and debuffs last for 3 rounds unless otherwise specified.)

Raucous and untamed, she is a study in contrasts - sitting stoically preparing for battle, or pealing with the unhinged laughter of the damned. „ ~ Survivalist Camping skills are special skills heroes can use while they are camping . They take a certain number of "respite" points to use, and can only be used once per camp (unless the skill says otherwise). Most heroes have three shared camping skills and all heroes have 4 unique camping skills (with the Flagellant being the exception, having only unique camping skills). Only 4 of these can be equipped at one time. Any Buffs or lasting effects given from a camping skill lasts for 4 battles.

The Hellion has seven; 2 common, 2 Crimson Court and 1 uncommon, rare and very rare. In the base game, her lower level trinkets are pendants and her high level trinkets are hairpins. The Crimson Court DLC adds war paint and the clasp around her waist, while the Color of Madness adds a halberd blade that's been half-way melted off by some celestial substance The Crimson Court DLC added special Trinket Sets, two for each hero. They confer powerful bonuses to the hero equipped with them, and having both equipped at once yields an additional bonus, which is shown greyed out at the bottom. The origin dungeon for all Trinket Sets is the Courtyard and they all have the rarity Crimson Court . The Shieldbreaker Trinket Set , however, is only obtainable through her final 6th and 7th nightmare encounters and won't be dropped or given as a reward in the Courtyard. Trinkets you already have will stop dropping, so there's value in not selling the ones you don't like until you get the ones you want. The Color of Madness DLC added trinkets with a new rarity, Crystalline . Each hero has their own unique crystalline trinket which can be bought from Jeweler inside the Nomad Wagon with Crystal Shards found within the Farmstead . District Bonus The Crimson Court DLC adds Districts to the Hamlet , some of which confer passive benefits to heroes. Districts Name Effect Cost Outsiders Bonfire 2 additional Respite Points if you have at least one Abomination , Hellion , or Leper in your party. Note: the stated bonus is granted as long as the party contains at least one hero that meets the criteria; the party will not receive extra respite points for bringing more such heroes. 1000 (1000) 300 1 Trivia The predetermined name for the Hellion is Boudica, an allusion to the British Celtic Iceni tribe's queen who led an uprising against the invading roman army during the reign of Nero in AD 60 or 61, she died shortly after its failure and is regarded as a British folk hero. Celtic warriors were known for painting their faces, a practice reflected in the Hellion's appearance. The name of the skill Barbaric Yawp is taken directly from the poem Song of Myself by Walt Whitman: "I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.", which is featured in a scene of the movie Dead Poets Society (1989). The name of the skill If It Bleeds is from a quote from the movie Predator (1987) : "If it bleeds, we can kill it!" The name of the skill Iron Swan is taken from a song of the same name from the album Age of Winter (2006) by The Sword . Based on her quotes while irrational, it is likely that she or the people from her tribe practice cannibalism. view Heroes in Darkest Dungeon Heroes Abomination Antiquarian Arbalest Bounty Hunter Crusader Grave Robber Hellion Highwayman Houndmaster Jester Leper Man-at-Arms Occultist Plague Doctor Vestal DLC Flagellant Musketeer Shieldbreaker
