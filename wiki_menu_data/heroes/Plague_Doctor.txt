Eager to prove the effectiveness of her latest untested concoction, she will inject herself - blindly faithful in its beneficial results. „ ~ Survivalist Camping skills are special skills heroes can use while they are camping . They take a certain number of "respite" points to use, and can only be used once per camp (unless the skill says otherwise). Most heroes have three shared camping skills and all heroes have 4 unique camping skills (with the Flagellant being the exception, having only unique camping skills). Only 4 of these can be equipped at one time. Any Buffs or lasting effects given from a camping skill lasts for 4 battles. The Plague Doctor practices and experiments during camp, and her tonics yield health benefits for the party and herself. She can cure disease, buff and heal. Experimental Vapours Time Cost Target Description 4 One Companion Heal 50% HP +33% Healing Received (4 Battles) Bark "Inhale this. It *should* make you feel much better."

"Fear wears off in time, much like a mild poison." Equipment “ The Plague Doctor wears only light cloth - intent on remaining as far from melee combat as possible. From a distance she lobs toxic sachets that can blind, disorient, and eat away at her foes. „ ~ Blacksmith Equipment upgrades are all bought at the Blacksmith .

The Plague Doctor has eight; 3 common, 2 Crimson Court and 1 uncommon, rare and very rare. In the base game, her trinkets are herbs, vials, and a censer. The Crimson Court DLC adds a subject notes and dissection tools. The Crimson Court DLC added special Trinket Sets, two for each hero. They confer powerful bonuses to the hero equipped with them, and having both equipped at once yields an additional bonus, which is shown greyed out at the bottom. The origin dungeon for all Trinket Sets is the Courtyard and they all have the rarity Crimson Court . The Shieldbreaker Trinket Set , however, is only obtainable through her final 6th and 7th nightmare encounters and won't be dropped or given as a reward in the Courtyard. Trinkets you already have will stop dropping, so there's value in not selling the ones you don't like until you get the ones you want. The Color of Madness DLC added trinkets with a new rarity, Crystalline . Each hero has their own unique crystalline trinket which can be bought from Jeweler inside the Nomad Wagon with Crystal Shards found within the Farmstead . District Bonus The Crimson Court DLC adds Districts to the Hamlet , some of which confer passive buffs to heroes.

While most characters have seven trinkets, The Crusader , Highwayman , Plague Doctor , and Vestal all have the most at eight. The plague doctors of popular culture (those of the time of the bubonic plague) were not officials and many were completely unqualified. Those who took up the iconic garb were mostly young, inexperienced outcasts from the world of medicine at the time. These individuals were known to create and sell radical, bizarre, and quackish remedies based on personal theories. "Auribus Teneo Lupum", mentioned in a Hopeless camping quote, is Latin for "Holding a Wolf by the Ears". It describes a situation in which there is no right answer or no good outcome. view Heroes in Darkest Dungeon Heroes Abomination Antiquarian Arbalest Bounty Hunter Crusader Grave Robber Hellion Highwayman Houndmaster Jester Leper Man-at-Arms Occultist Plague Doctor Vestal DLC Flagellant Musketeer Shieldbreaker
