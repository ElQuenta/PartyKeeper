She strikes without warning and retreats to the shadows, continuing her assault at range. If her throwing daggers and poison darts aren't getting the job done, she can return to the melee, buffed and slinging her pickaxe! „ ~ Guild Note: New Grave Robbers will always come with the Shadow Fade skill.

She may reluctantly confess to pilfering an item in the Hamlet prior to departure, or entertain those with a similarly morbid sense of humor with a biting and ironic wit. „ ~ Survivalist Camping skills are special skills heroes can use while they are camping . They take a certain number of "respite" points to use, and can only be used once per camp (unless the skill says otherwise). Most heroes have three shared camping skills and all heroes have 4 unique camping skills (with the Flagellant being the exception, having only unique camping skills). Only 4 of these can be equipped at one time. Any Buffs or lasting effects given from a camping skill lasts for 4 battles. The Grave Robber's camping skills are each distinct from each other, giving her a fair bit of utility. She can increase scouting chance, heal Diseases , resupply the party with an item, or attempt to heal stress (but that can backfire).

The Grave Robber has seven; 2 common, 2 Crimson Court, and 1 uncommon, rare, and very rare. In the base game, her lower level trinkets are satchels and her high level trinkets are talismans. The Color of Madness DLC adds a tonic, while The Crimson Court DLC adds a letter opener and absinthe, a highly alcoholic drink that was illegal in many western countries for parts of the 20th century. The Crimson Court DLC added special Trinket Sets, two for each hero. They confer powerful bonuses to the hero equipped with them, and having both equipped at once yields an additional bonus, which is shown greyed out at the bottom. The origin dungeon for all Trinket Sets is the Courtyard and they all have the rarity Crimson Court . The Shieldbreaker Trinket Set , however, is only obtainable through her final 6th and 7th nightmare encounters and won't be dropped or given as a reward in the Courtyard. Trinkets you already have will stop dropping, so there's value in not selling the ones you don't like until you get the ones you want. The Color of Madness DLC added trinkets with a new rarity, Crystalline . Each hero has their own unique crystalline trinket which can be bought from Jeweler inside the Nomad Wagon with Crystal Shards found within the Farmstead . District Bonus The Crimson Court DLC adds Districts to the Hamlet , some of which confer passive benefits to heroes. Districts Name Effect Cost House of the Yellow Hand Bounty Hunter , Grave Robber , and Highwayman receive: +4% CRIT +5% Scouting Chance 5000 (1000) 100 1 Trivia The Grave Robber and the Highwayman share many similarities, such as both being evasive, hard-hitting classes, a similar skill set, and being the only classes to share a unique camping skill, that being Gallows Humor. Previously, when Grave Robber was using her skill "Shadow Fade" when dealing the last attack in the encounter, a glitch could be encountered where Grave Robber's texture does not return on her place and she remains invisible. The team were starting to slowly turn back without stepping animations and they couldn't move forward. This may be a reason why "Shadow Fade" deals no damage now. However, the developers never mentioned that glitch in their patch notes, and the glitch was probably fixed by an accident once the developers decided that gas attacks should deal no damage at all. Several of the Grave Robber's barks suggest that she is of high society, particularly her line "I was a Lady once. Now, little more than a burglar." (spoken upon being afflicted with Hopeless ). Additionally, when she uses the camping skill Wound Care, she mentions she knows a little about crocheting. Her comic reveals that she was a member of a once wealthy family (implied to be ruined by her husband/father) who had to resort to grave robbing. According to the Grave Robber 's backstory in Darkest Dungeon II , she poisoned her husband to escape his abuse and take full advantage of his fortune. The Razor's Edge is a reference to the AC/DC album of the same name. The predetermined name of the Grave Robber is Audrey, a reference to the wife of the game's creative director and artist, Chris Bourassa. view Heroes in Darkest Dungeon Heroes Abomination Antiquarian Arbalest Bounty Hunter Crusader Grave Robber Hellion Highwayman Houndmaster Jester Leper Man-at-Arms Occultist Plague Doctor Vestal DLC Flagellant Musketeer Shieldbreaker
