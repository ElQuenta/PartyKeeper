Together they stalk the back ranks, bursting forth in a flurry of harrying bleeds, gnashing teeth, and stunning blows. Should the tide of battle turn, the pair can support an ailing party by protecting the weak, and rallying the stressed. „ ~ Guild Note: New Houndmasters will always come with the Hound's Rush skill.

To this end, the Houndmaster can send his Wolfhound to scout ahead, or put him on watch to ensure a good night's rest. If spirits are low, the dog's affectionate companionship can soften the heart, and ease the mind. „ ~ Survivalist Camping skills are special skills heroes can use while they are camping . They take a certain number of "respite" points to use, and can only be used once per camp (unless the skill says otherwise). Most heroes have three shared camping skills and all heroes have 4 unique camping skills (with the Flagellant being the exception, having only unique camping skills). Only 4 of these can be equipped at one time. Any Buffs or lasting effects given from a camping skill lasts for 4 battles. The Houndmaster focuses on using his hound to keep the party safe and set their minds at ease. His hound can also scout ahead or keep watch during the night .

Equipment “ Still clad in his worn Gendarme's uniform, the Houndmaster's focus is on evasion over mitigation. His cudgel is an effective stunning tool, but it is the Hound who delivers the pair's most crippling blows, especially when he's been fed an invigorating snack! „ ~ Blacksmith Equipment upgrades are all bought at the Blacksmith .

The Houndmaster has seven; 2 common, 2 Crimson Court and 1 uncommon, rare and very rare. In the base game, his common trinkets are whistles, his uncommon trinket is a weight for his club and his high level trinkets are dog collars. The Color of Madness DLC adds another whistle, though one covered in crystal, while The Crimson Court DLC adds incriminating evidence and his old badge from when he was a lawman. The Crimson Court DLC added special Trinket Sets, two for each hero. They confer powerful bonuses to the hero equipped with them, and having both equipped at once yields an additional bonus, which is shown greyed out at the bottom. The origin dungeon for all Trinket Sets is the Courtyard and they all have the rarity Crimson Court . The Shieldbreaker Trinket Set , however, is only obtainable through her final 6th and 7th nightmare encounters and won't be dropped or given as a reward in the Courtyard. Trinkets you already have will stop dropping, so there's value in not selling the ones you don't like until you get the ones you want. The Color of Madness DLC added trinkets with a new rarity, Crystalline . Each hero has their own unique crystalline trinket which can be bought from Jeweler inside the Nomad Wagon with Crystal Shards found within the Farmstead . District Bonus The Crimson Court DLC adds Districts to the Hamlet , some of which confer passive benefits to heroes.

The Battered Lawman's Badge and Evidence of Corruption trinkets reference the Houndmaster's lore comic which depicts other lawmen killing a missing woman that the Houndmaster was searching for. This is further evidenced with the quote that is attached to the trinkets. The current predetermined name for the Houndmaster is Willam, and his hound is named Fergus. The Dog Treats are a reference to the Scooby Snacks from Scooby Doo. This is further reinforced by the previous predetermined name for the Houndmaster, Shag and Scoob. The meaning of Gendarme in the Houndmaster's last armor upgrade, Gendarme's Pride is a French word referring to "a soldier who is employed on police duties." This makes sense as the Houndmaster was previously a lawman and it may also hint that he is French in origin. In the Houndmaster's artwork, he is shown with a bloodhound, but in the game, he has an Irish Wolfhound. One of the lines uttered upon turning Irrational references Laika, the female dog that was loaded on the Sputnik 2 satellite, becoming the first animal to be put on an orbiting space vessel. The skill Cry Havoc was named after Mark Anthony's line: "... Cry 'Havoc!', and let slip the dogs of war..." in Act 3, Scene 1, line 273 of William Shakespeare 's Julius Caesar . The "I am the Law!" bark when the Houndmaster becomes courageous is a direct quote from Judge Dredd. The Hopeless dialogue line "Ah! The old familiar sting" is likely a reference to the song "Hurt" by Nine Inch Nails. There is a small inconsistency of the dog's gender. The blacksmith says " when he's been fed an invigorating snack" implying the dog is male. However, many barks from the Houndmaster himself refer to the dog as "girl", "princess" and other related terms, implying that it is actually female. However in English a masculine neutral is common, such as saying "you guys" to a group of males and females. So, the Blacksmith not knowing the dog's gender would refer to it as such while the owner would appropriately call them female. view Heroes in Darkest Dungeon Heroes Abomination Antiquarian Arbalest Bounty Hunter Crusader Grave Robber Hellion Highwayman Houndmaster Jester Leper Man-at-Arms Occultist Plague Doctor Vestal DLC Flagellant Musketeer Shieldbreaker
