Newly recruited Vestals will always have Divine Grace equipped. Illumination is coded to never result in a Critical Hit , and it is the only damaging skill in the game that is coded this way. Camping Skills “ Prayers, chants, and blessings bring peace and solace to the Vestal and her party. She can improve a companion's combat prowess, or instead focus on reducing the group's stress, and making the campsite a safe place for a good night's rest. „ ~ Survivalist Camping skills are special skills heroes can use while they are camping . They take a certain number of "respite" points to use, and can only be used once per camp (unless the skill says otherwise). Most heroes have three shared camping skills and all heroes have 4 unique camping skills (with the Flagellant being the exception, having only unique camping skills). Only 4 of these can be equipped at one time. Any Buffs or lasting effects given from a camping skill lasts for 4 battles. The Vestal is an ecclesiastical and evangelistic woman, spending her camping time comforting her allies with her religion. She sing hymns, chants and prays for her companions by the power of the Light. While effective on all heroes, those who are also religious or who have nearly experienced death will receive the most benefit and comfort from her pious rituals.

The Vestal has eight; 2 uncommon, 2 rare, 2 Crimson Court and 1 common and very rare. In the base game, her lower level trinkets are chalices and her high level trinkets are scrolls and a tome. The Crimson Court DLC adds a diary and beads. The Crimson Court DLC added special Trinket Sets, two for each hero. They confer powerful bonuses to the hero equipped with them, and having both equipped at once yields an additional bonus, which is shown greyed out at the bottom. The origin dungeon for all Trinket Sets is the Courtyard and they all have the rarity Crimson Court . The Shieldbreaker Trinket Set , however, is only obtainable through her final 6th and 7th nightmare encounters and won't be dropped or given as a reward in the Courtyard. Trinkets you already have will stop dropping, so there's value in not selling the ones you don't like until you get the ones you want. The Color of Madness DLC added trinkets with a new rarity, Crystalline . Each hero has their own unique crystalline trinket which can be bought from Jeweler inside the Nomad Wagon with Crystal Shards found within the Farmstead . District Bonus The Crimson Court DLC adds Districts to the Hamlet , some of which confer passive benefits to heroes.

The Vestal's quote on applying a virtuous buff while Focused, "What grace has given me, let it pass to you, hero", is a reference to a similar quote from Arwen Undómiel of The Lord of the Rings: "What grace is given me, let it pass to him. Let him be spared. Save him." While most characters have seven trinkets, The Crusader , Highwayman , Plague Doctor and Vestal all have the most at eight. The Vestal is also the only character to have two rare trinkets The fifth level weapon has the same name as one of her attacks - " Hand of Light ". Many of her barks when afflicted, particularly hopeless and irrational, along with her origin comic point toward her not being chaste enough, and other barks imply that she was forced into becoming a nun. Several barks while irrational imply that she (and other nuns) were whipped daily in the convent view Heroes in Darkest Dungeon Heroes Abomination Antiquarian Arbalest Bounty Hunter Crusader Grave Robber Hellion Highwayman Houndmaster Jester Leper Man-at-Arms Occultist Plague Doctor Vestal DLC Flagellant Musketeer Shieldbreaker
