Crit Buff Bonus +33% DMG vs Marked Religious No Provisions Bandage “ Shoot, bandage, and pillage­­ - the dancing steps of war! „ ~ The Ancestor The Arbalest is a back-rank support/damage hero in Darkest Dungeon . Her strengths include: Very high ACC on most of her attacks. Decent DMG boosted by extremely strong Mark synergy. Very high HP, especially for a back-rank hero. A great assortment of support skills, from healing the party to debuffing the enemy team's damage. Her weaknesses are: Many of her skills are weak in the early game, but scale very well with levels and Trinkets . Her low SPD. Though this is not too bad because it enables SPD control, notably allowing another hero to Mark before her. The vast majority of her abilities can only be used in ranks 3 and 4, so she is almost always placed in the back ranks. Some builds place her in rank 2 with the expectation that a fast dancer teammate (e.g. Jester , Grave Robber , Highwayman ) will move forward on the first turn.

The Arbalest splits her time at rest, providing expert first aid care, and preparing for the next leg of the journey with optimized marching plans and a fresh, taut bowstring. „ ~ Survivalist Camping skills are special skills heroes can use while they are camping . They take a certain number of "respite" points to use, and can only be used once per camp (unless the skill says otherwise). Most heroes have three shared camping skills and all heroes have 4 unique camping skills (with the Flagellant being the exception, having only unique camping skills). Only 4 of these can be equipped at one time. Any Buffs or lasting effects given from a camping skill lasts for 4 battles. The Arbalest is a proficient medic at camp, able to heal all her companions or one ally greatly. She can also increase everyone else's speed or power-up her bow at the cost of her own speed.

Able to decimate enemies at range with a dizzying array of ammunition, she wears medium plate for increased protection against the volleys she knows are coming... „ ~ Blacksmith Equipment upgrades are all bought at the Blacksmith .

The Arbalest has seven; 2 common, 2 Crimson Court and 1 uncommon, rare and very rare. In the base game, her lower level trinkets are greaves and her high level trinkets are bandanas. The Crimson Court DLC adds a stuffed animal and crossbow bolt, while The Color of Madness DLC added crystal bolts The Crimson Court DLC added special Trinket Sets, two for each hero. They confer powerful bonuses to the hero equipped with them, and having both equipped at once yields an additional bonus, which is shown greyed out at the bottom. The origin dungeon for all Trinket Sets is the Courtyard and they all have the rarity Crimson Court . The Shieldbreaker Trinket Set , however, is only obtainable through her final 6th and 7th nightmare encounters and won't be dropped or given as a reward in the Courtyard. Trinkets you already have will stop dropping, so there's value in not selling the ones you don't like until you get the ones you want. The Color of Madness DLC added trinkets with a new rarity, Crystalline . Each hero has their own unique crystalline trinket which can be bought from Jeweler inside the Nomad Wagon with Crystal Shards found within the Farmstead . District Bonus The Crimson Court DLC adds Districts to the Hamlet , some of which confer passive benefits to heroes. Districts Name Effect Cost Training Ring Arbalest , Houndmaster , Man-at-Arms , Shieldbreaker , and Musketeer receive: +4 ACC +10% MAX HP 5000 (1000) 300 1 Trivia "Millicent", the name of her highest level weapon, is a female medieval name whose Germanic roots are the words for "work" and "strength". "Arbalest" actually refers to a type of crossbow, not to the wielders themselves as noted by the blacksmith. However this may just be the Blacksmith refering to the Arbalest in the general sense like "The Crusader" meaning it's the reverse case and not incorrect. Her predetermined name, Missandei, is a reference to a character found in George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series. One of her camping skill barks, "If it bleeds, we can slay it," is a reference to the 1987 movie Predator . One of her Irrational barks, "Have you ever seen a colour out of space?," is a reference to the title of H.P. Lovecraft's short story The Colour Out of Space . The Color of Madness DLC is also based on this short story. view Heroes in Darkest Dungeon Heroes Abomination Antiquarian Arbalest Bounty Hunter Crusader Grave Robber Hellion Highwayman Houndmaster Jester Leper Man-at-Arms Occultist Plague Doctor Vestal DLC Flagellant Musketeer Shieldbreaker
