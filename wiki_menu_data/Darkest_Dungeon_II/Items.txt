Items in Darkest Dungeon consist of Provisions , Loot , and Trinkets . Contents 1 Loot 2 Heirlooms 3 Trinkets 4 Persistent Provisions 5 Quest Items 6 Achievements Loot The various Loot items in Darkest Dungeon are available for pickup after defeating monsters or finding them in curios . These are items of high value which are sold for gold upon returning to the Hamlet. Gems' stack size is increased by 1 with the Geological Studyhall District (excluding Tapestries, both types of Antiques, and Pews). * Every Antiquarian in the party increases the amount of gold in a stack by 750. ** Antiques will only appear when there is an Antiquarian in the party. *** Consecrated Pews are dropped only by the Pews that guard The Prophet . Heirlooms Heirlooms are a special kind of loot that is used to upgrade buildings in the Town . In addition to gaining heirlooms for finishing a dungeon, additional heirlooms can be collected while exploring. The Crimson Court DLC adds two new kinds of heirlooms: Blueprints which are used to build Districts , and Invitations which are used to enter the Courtyard . Here is a short list of what each heirloom upgrades: Crests are used to upgrade all buildings in town. Portraits are used to upgrade the Guild and the Tavern . Busts are used to upgrade the Abbey and the Sanitarium . Deeds are used to upgrade the Stage Coach and the Blacksmith . Blueprints are used to build Districts . Originally in the base game each area had one specific heirloom given as quest rewards. While this is no longer the case for most quests, it is still true for bosses. Ruins : Busts/Crests Weald : Deeds/Crests Warrens : Portraits/Crests Cove : Crest (three times as much in other areas) Trinkets Trinkets are equippable items that can be found in the dungeons, gained as a quest reward, or bought at the Nomad Wagon . Each hero is able to carry two different trinkets with various effects. Persistent Provisions These are special types of provisions only available in DLC. Unlike other provisions, they cannot be bought from the Caretaker, and instead must be found in dungeons dropped by special monsters (with the only exception being The Blood, which can be generated from the Sanguine Vintners .) If they are not removed from the inventory when the quest ends, instead of being sold back to the Caretaker, they will be placed in the Caretaker's shop as a free provision, which the player can take at any time up to the number of provisions they have. Quest Items Some quests require the player to retrieve certain items or activate Curios with special items given at the start of the quest. Each region's items are unique. Achievements
