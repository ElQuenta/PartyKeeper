Their large shield leaves them well-armored and capable of taking a beating, and they can use this resilience to protect the other undead soldiers guarding the area. Contents 1 Behavior 1.1 Skill Selection 1.2 Skill Targeting 2 Abilities 3 Related Enemies 3.1 All Areas 3.2 Ruins 3.3 Boss 4 Gallery Behavior The Defender is an Unholy enemy that always appears at the front and aims to frustrate your heroes with his hefty PROT and stun/move ability Dead Weight, whilst chipping away at their health with his axe. If pushed to the back he will move forwards with his near useless Clumsy Axeblade attack. Generally speaking, despite the potential annoyance of Dead Weight, unless you have a Blight attack spare, you should leave him alone at the start of battle and concentrate on the more vulnerable troops he is protecting. As of the Radiant Update, the Veteran and Champion Defenders have a new skill: Foul Warding. It is a guard skill much like the Pelagic Guardian 's Barnacle Barrier, guarding allies and conferring a PROT bonus to the Defender. Should the Defender use this skill, a simple Stun will cause it to drop its guard. The PROT bonus may persist, but its ally will become vulnerable. Skill Selection If it's the Defender's first turn, he has a 4/5 chance to select Axeblade and a 1/5 chance to select Dead Weight . Afterwards, he has an equal chance to select either skill. If three or more heroes are Stunned , the Defender will be prevented from using Dead Weight and will be guaranteed to select Axeblade . If the Defender is in Rank 3 or 4, he will always select Clumsy Axeblade . If it's the Defender's first turn, he has a 5/10 chance to select Axeblade , a 1/10 chance to select Dead Weight and a 4/10 chance to select Foul Warding . Afterwards, he has a 2/7 chance to select Axeblade , a 1/7 chance to select Dead Weight and a 4/7 chance to select Foul Warding . If two or more monsters are Guarded , the Defender will not select Foul Warding . If three or more heroes are Stunned , the Defender will not select Dead Weight . If the Defender is in Rank 3 or 4, he has a 4/5 chance to select Foul Warding and a 1/5 chance to select Clumsy Axeblade . If Foul Warding is on cooldown and the Defender is in Rank 3 or 4, he will always select Clumsy Axeblade . If it's the Defender's first turn, he has a 5/8 chance to select Axeblade , a 1/8 chance to select Dead Weight and a 2/8 chance to select Foul Warding . Afterwards, he has a 2/5 chance to select Axeblade , a 1/5 chance to select Dead Weight and a 2/5 chance to select Foul Warding . If two or more monsters are Guarded , the Defender will not select Foul Warding If three or more heroes are Stunned , the Defender will not select Dead Weight . If the Defender is in Rank 3 or 4, he has a 2/3 chance to select Foul Warding and a 1/3 chance to select Clumsy Axeblade . If Foul Warding is on cooldown and the Defender is in Rank 3 or 4, he will always select Clumsy Axeblade . Skill Targeting Note that "+100% chance" in the context of skill targeting doesn't mean that targeting will be guaranteed against that victim. Consider the scenario where a skill can target four heroes - if one of these four heroes has a +100% chance to be targeted by that skill, it will amount to that hero having a 2/5 chance to be targeted, with the three other heroes each having a 1/5 chance to be targeted.
