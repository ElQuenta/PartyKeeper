He alone can operate the terrible Brigand Cannon , unleashing thundering blasts of fire and death that can easily decimate even the healthiest of parties. Contents 1 Behavior 2 Abilities 3 Gallery 4 Related Enemies 4.1 All Areas 4.2 Bosses 5 Trivia Behavior The Brigand Matchman is a special enemy found only during the Brigand Pounder boss fight and usually spawns on the third or fourth rank. The Matchman has low health, low resistances to status effects, and ludicrously low speed (He will always act last on a given turn). However, if he is allowed to act, he will activate the Pounder and allow it to use its devastating attack. As such, he should be considered the highest priority target during the fight and eliminated before he is allowed to act. Additionally, if he is felled, the Pounder will always summon a new Matchman at the beginning of the next turn. Once the Pounder is destroyed, the Matchman and all Brigands will die with it, ending the battle.
