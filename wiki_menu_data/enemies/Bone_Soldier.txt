Unlike the Bone Rabble , Bone Soldiers are better-armored and wield more effective weapons, letting them hit harder and last longer on the battlefield. Still, they remain relatively weak and are easily dispatched. Contents 1 Behavior 2 Abilities 3 Trivia 4 Related Enemies 4.1 All Areas 4.2 Ruins 4.3 Boss 5 Gallery Behavior Bone Soldier is an Unholy creature, and is as basic an enemy as one can encounter within the Ruins. The finesse it had in life persists in death, giving it above-average damage and allowing it to strike with a farther reach than most other melee monsters. Depending on whether health or stress is of greater concern to your party at the moment, it is recommended to destroy either the Soldier or the Bone Courtier they often team up with as quickly as possible, a relatively easy task considering their low health. Even mundane damage can eventually build up to something more threatening. Abilities Trivia The Bone Soldier's attack "Graveyard Slash" is most likely a reference to the song "Monster Mash" by Bobby Pickett.
