Description Like other Gaunts , the Urchin is typically encountered in Road Battles and at the Chirurgeon's Table . The Urchin's behaviour is fairly predictable. In the front ranks, he will use Skulking Step to move himself Back . Then he will play Song of Shadows to gain Stealth and Crit , and if he still has the following turn, he will play Haunting Melody , rushing to the front and inflicting high Stress and damage on the target. The Urchin is usually a high priority target in Gaunt battles: his stats are very weak, but he becomes much more dangerous if left alone for a round or two.
