================================================================================

Almost every item that appears in Confessions mode also appears in Kingdoms , and additionally there some items exclusive to Kingdoms . Major changes include: Inn items buffs and debuffs normally last 3 regions as opposed to 1 region to compensate for regions being shorter in Kingdoms . However, food item effects still usually last for 1 region. Many items now heal Fatigue . Items related to Confessions -unique mechanics (like Candles of Hope and Flames ) do not appear.
