Like the player's own Arbalests , they operate by firing crossbow bolts into the fray from the safety of the back ranks, and end up in an awkward position if drawn to the front. Contents 1 Behavior 2 Abilities 3 Gallery 4 Related Enemies 4.1 All Areas 4.2 Ruins 4.3 Boss Behavior When encountered, the Bone Arbalist will always spawn on the third and/or fourth rank. While in the rear ranks, he will use his Quarrel ability to snipe your heroes in the third or fourth ranks. This attack is quite powerful on its own and has a good chance to crit. However, this attack is even more lethal to heroes that have been marked . Be especially careful if the Arbalist is joined by a Cultist Acolyte on Veteran and Champion levels. A good strategy is to take advantage of the Arbalist's low move resistance and bring him to the front ranks. While in the first or second rank, he will use his Bayonet Jab ability, which is substantially weaker but does move him back one rank. Additionally, this attack can only target the heroes in the first two ranks, who usually have higher defenses.
