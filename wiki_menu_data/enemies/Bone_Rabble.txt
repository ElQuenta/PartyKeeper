Compared to other enemies, the Rabble is very weak. Contents 1 Behavior 2 Abilities 3 Related Enemies 3.1 Ruins 3.2 Boss 4 Gallery Behavior The Bone Rabble is an Unholy -type enemy that can be found in almost any area, although it is most common in the Ruins . It is often encountered in pairs, with both individuals taking up the first two ranks. With low HP, no protection , low speed , very poor resistances (save for bleed ), and weak, inaccurate attacks, this enemy is by far the weakest of all Unholy enemies and should be considered a very low priority in battle. Its main purpose is to use its body (or corpse ) to protect enemies in the back of the formation, although its Bump in the Night attack can reduce the victim's Dodge stat by a fairly significant amount in Veteran or Champion levels.
