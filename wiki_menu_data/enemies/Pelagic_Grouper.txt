Contents 1 Behavior and Strategy 2 Abilities 3 Related Enemies 4 Gallery 5 Trivia Behavior and Strategy Unlike most Cove enemies, which inflict which status effects like Stuns , Disease , and Stress , Pelagic Grouper focuses almost exclusively on dealing damage—and it deals a lot of it! Grouper's targeting is determined by its position: in the front two ranks it will use Seaward Slash on front-rank heroes, and in the back ranks it will use Spearfishing on back-rank heroes. Both attacks deal considerable damage. Spearfishing can pull the hero one rank forward in Veteran and Champion dungeons. A commonly seen and often problematic formation is four Groupers at once, capable of delivering an extreme amount physical damage across the entire party. Groupers are fast, but have very low resistances to everything except Bleed .
