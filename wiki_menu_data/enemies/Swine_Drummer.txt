Carrying around a drum made from the flayed skin of its victims, the Drummers act by pounding on their drums as loudly as possible. The Drummer coordinates their allies by marking a hero to attack, but sometimes the sound of the drum alone, echoing in the enclosed spaces of the Warrens, can be a stressful thing to hear. Contents 1 Behavior 2 Abilities 3 Related Enemies 3.1 Swinefolk 3.2 Bosses 4 Gallery Behavior The Swine Drummer is a Human / Beast type enemy that is only encountered in the Warrens . It usually spawns in the back ranks of a Swine Party and serves as a support unit. The Swine Drummer is a dangerous enemy in that its attacks can inflict debuffs and stress damage to the party. It also has the ability to Mark party members to increase the damage of other enemies. The Swine Drummer should be dealt with quickly to limit the effects of its attacks. On its own, the Drummer has a decent amount of health and speed, but has no protection and fairly low resistances to status effects.
