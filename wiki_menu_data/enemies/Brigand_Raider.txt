Contents 1 Behavior 2 Abilities 3 Related Enemies 3.1 All Areas 3.2 Bosses 4 Gallery 5 Trivia Behavior The Brigand Raider is a stronger variant of the Brigand Cutthroat which appears during Wolves at the Door , and within Champion-level dungeons. They will also be summoned by Brigand Vvulf during his boss fight. Raiders do more damage than Cutthroats, and unlike their lower-level counterparts, their Shank ability will also apply marks to its target - which can be a real problem when they're fought alongside Rabid Gnashers . The tactics used to defeat them are more or less identical to those used to defeat Cutthroats - just try not to let them get in too many hits.
