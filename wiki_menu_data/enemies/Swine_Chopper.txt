When not ferociously butchering the cold and mangled flesh of his soon-to-be dinner, the Swine Chopper will happily test its bloody, serrated cleaver upon the bodies of naive adventurers who might happen upon its squalid home. Slow and hulking, the Chopper also wields a heavy ball and chain to extend its range with head-ringing efficiency. Contents 1 Behavior 2 Abilities 3 Related Enemies 3.1 Swinefolk 3.2 Bosses 4 Gallery Behavior The Swine Chopper - a Human / Beast enemy that appears in the Warrens and is the bulky front line troops of the Swine, Choppers are as adept at walling damage as they are at dishing it out. They can cause bleed with Butcher Cut , and can stun any hero with their Ball and Chain . They should generally be prioritized behind the more fragile Swine support units; their fairly low resistances to bleed and stun make these good strategies against them. They also have essentially no debuff resistance and low accuracy, so any accuracy-reducing moves are likely to neuter their attacks. Keep in mind, however, that on Veteran and Champion level, he is able to impair the healing of your heroes.
