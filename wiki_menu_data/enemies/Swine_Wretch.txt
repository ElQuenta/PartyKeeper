While smaller in size and weaker defensively compared to other Swinefolk, the Swine Wretch is a major threat in the Warrens because of its high chance of spreading Diseases with every attack. Like other Swinefolk, the Swine Wretch appears to have both human and animal body parts; however, while most Swinefolk have Beast/Human type , Swine Wretches only have a single type, Beast. Contents 1 Behavior 2 Abilities 3 Related Enemies 3.1 Swinefolk 3.2 Bosses 4 Gallery Behavior The Swine Wretch appears in either the third or fourth rank. While the Wretch has low health and relatively low resistances, it is very quick and evasive, and will often act before the party does. The Wretch possesses only a single attack, Vomit , which deals stress and may inflict a random Disease upon its target. Because of how debilitating certain diseases can be, not to mention how annoying they are to treat, it is best to deal with the Wretch as quickly as possible.
