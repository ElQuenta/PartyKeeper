While live humans become Fungal Scratchers , infected corpses are twisted into the Fungal Artillery . Though not as well-armored or resilient as the Scratchers, the Fungal Artillery possesses more potent poisons and carries the ability to mark heroes for its Scratcher companions to attack, while operating from the safety of the enemy back ranks. Contents 1 Behavior 2 Abilities 3 Related Enemies 3.1 Weald 3.2 Bosses 4 Gallery Behavior Its Rain of Blight can inflict Blight upon those within your back ranks, and it can mark heroes in the front with Mark Prey, signalling where its allies can find vulnerable prey. If it's ever pulled into the front ranks, it will use Escape Cloud to move its position backwards by one, and will continue to do so until it has returned to position 3. These enemies will always be accompanied by Fungal Scratchers and possibly Unclean Giants , and should be eliminated first - their blight damage can add up quickly, and their marks allow the Scratchers to do massive damage.
