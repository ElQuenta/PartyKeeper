While they have very little in the way of health and status resistances, they possess a rather high protection stat and are capable of inflicting heavy damage to any rank from anywhere with their sole attack; Hook Where It Hurts . In addition to a high crit chance , this attack also moves the Swine Slasher back one rank, making it harder for your front line heroes to deal damage to it. On Veteran and Champion levels, this attack can also inflict a Debuff that will make your heroes more likely to contract a Disease or succumb to Bleeding (keep this in mind when healing with the Occultist ). With these attributes, this enemy should be considered a high priority in battle.
