Consisting of a vast system of piers, jetties, and stilted shacks, the area has been covered by a supernatural fog. The stench of salt, rotting wood, and decomposing fish hangs in the air. When ancient monoliths began to sprout of the sea, dredged up by some unexplained force, the denizens of the coastal village saw a simple choice: to give oneself to the waves in worship, or to perish beneath the rising tides. The waters readily accepted their offering, and thus the Fisherfolk were reborn in the image of their new sea god.
