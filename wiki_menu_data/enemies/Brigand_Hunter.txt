Contents 1 Behavior 2 Abilities 3 Related Enemies 3.1 All Areas 3.2 Bosses 4 Gallery 5 Trivia Behavior The Brigand Hunter is a stronger variant of the Brigand Fusilier which can be seen during Wolves at the Door , and within Champion-level dungeons. Just like the Brigand Fusilier, Hunters have high speed and will often be the first or the second to attack each round. However, they are much more dangerous: unlike Fusiliers, their version of Blanket Fire does more than scratch damage, and inflicts stress on your party along with the usual debuff. This can be particularly nasty during Wolves at the Door, when they may be accompanied by a Madman . As with the Fusiliers, they will be forced to use a much weaker attack if pulled to the front. Also like the Fusiliers, you should take them out first.

Trivia The Brigand Hunter was added in the Everything Burns update, along with the Brigand Raider and the boss Brigand Vvulf . Originally the Brigand Hunter could only be found in the quest Wolves at the Door , but a later update added the possibility of encountering them in every normal champion level quest. view Enemies Shared Cultist Brawler Cultist Acolyte Brigand Cutthroat Brigand Fusilier Brigand Bloodletter Brigand Raider Brigand Hunter Madman Maggot Webber Spitter Bone Rabble Ghoul Gargoyle Supplicant Sycophant Manservant Gatekeeper Chevalier Pliskin Rattler Adder Ruins Bone Rabble Bone Soldier Bone Courtier Bone Arbalist Bone Defender Bone Spearman Bone Captain Bone Bearer Weald Ectoplasm Large Ectoplasm Fungal Scratcher Fungal Artillery Rabid Gnasher Crone Unclean Giant Hateful Virago Necrotic Fungus Warrens Swine Chopper Swine Slasher Swine Wretch Swine Drummer Carrion Eater Large Carrion Eater Swinetaur Swine Skiver Cove Pelagic Grouper Pelagic Shaman Pelagic Guardian Sea Maggot Deep Stinger Drowned Thrall Uca Major Squiffy Ghast Courtyard Supplicant Sycophant Chevalier Manservant Esquire Courtesan Carrion Eater Farmstead Crystalline Aberration Farmhand Foreman Scarecrow Plow Horse Sleeper's Herald Sleeper's Dream Darkest Dungeon Spoilers Ascended Brawler Ascended Witch Rapturous Cultist Cultist Priest Malignant Growth Defensive Growth Flesh Hound Polyp Templar Gladiator Templar Sniper Antibody White Cell Stalk
