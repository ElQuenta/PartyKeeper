“ A little hope, however desperate, is never without worth. „ ~ The Ancestor Abbey The Abbey is one of the Locations in the Town where you allow your Heroes to relieve Stress . The Abbey offers 3 different upgrades. Upgrading the Abbey increases the types of stress treatments and their effectiveness. Each visit comes with a 37.5% chance of a side effect, which can be either positive or negative. Positive and negative non-quirks (ie. hope, blood loss and bloodletting) will remain with the characters until they are taken on a quest.

Both the amount of Stress healed and the cost can be improved via upgrades. Note that the higher Level a hero is (Veteran, Champion), the higher the base costs for treating them.

Most either prevent them from an activity or force them into a certain one. The only exception to this is Meditator, which improves stress relief in the Cloister. Town Event The Abbey has 7 Town Events related to it. Event Image Event Name Description Effect Absent Abbot Woe to the sheep, for does the absence of the shepherd not invite the wolves? "The Abbot has sequestered himself in the wine cellar, ostensibly to consider how best to help his parishioners cope with the deluge of godless horrors that plague these lands." Transept is Locked, Cloister costs change by -50%, Penance Hall costs by -50% All Saints Day Take advantage of this faith-fueled charity - it will not last. "The abbey will be decorated for the duration of the event, and all are welcome to visit during the extended hours." Cloister is Free, Transept is Free, Penance Hall is Free Cell Cleaning No amount of scrubbing can remove the stains of such fearsome piety. "The Abbot will not comment on the condition of the Penance Hall at this time, except to say that he expects normal operations to be resumed shortly." Penance Hall is Locked, Cloister costs change by -50%, Transept costs change by -50% Noisy Repairs Ancient and crumbling, the Abbey's masonry fares no better than the faith of its congregation. "Indeed, the elements have not been kind to the old abbey; the very soil itself seems to reject the place. The work is expected to last through the week." Cloister is Locked, Transept costs change by -50%, Penance Hall costs change by -50% The Miserable Dark Windows and doors will be bolted. Tonight, something haunts the dark. "... As one man put it, "Somethin' aint right with them shadows - movin' and twistin' as they do." Residents are advised to stay indoors until daybreak." All Stress Relief Activities Less Effective Spreading the Curse If you have the Crimson Court DLC added, and you put a hero afflicted with the Crimson Curse in the Abbey, they could infect another hero being treated there.
