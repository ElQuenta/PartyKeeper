This article is about the game. For the in-game location, see Darkest Dungeon (location) . “ Darkest Dungeon is about making the best of a bad situation. Quests will fail or must be abandoned. Heroes will die. And when they die, they stay dead. Progress autosaves constantly, so actions are permanent. The game expects a lot out of you. How far will you push your adventurers? How much are you willing to risk in your quest to restore the Hamlet? What will you sacrifice to save the life of your favourite hero? „ ~ The premise of Darkest Dungeon Darkest Dungeon is a hard-core RPG about the stresses of dungeon crawling. You will lead a band of four Heroes on a perilous side-scrolling descent, dealing with a prodigious number of threats to their bodily health, and worse, a relentless assault on their mental fortitude! Five hundred feet below the earth you will not only fight unimaginable Foes , but famine, disease, and the stress of the ever-encroaching dark. Darkest Dungeon focuses on the humanity and psychological vulnerability of the heroes and asks: What emotional toll does a life of adventure take?

In the world of Darkest Dungeon , corruption and monsters have escaped the forgotten darkness of the deep and have overrun the once idyllic Estate of the player's late Ancestor, a scion of an ancient noble family. As if being plagued by disease and misery wasn't enough, the people of the impoverished Hamlet must now withstand unthinkable nightmares roaming the land. The cause of this evil was the Ancestor himself, who meddled with dark forces in pursuit of immortality after a lifetime of perverse debauchery and unsealed a nightmarish power entombed far below his mansion. At last appalled by his actions and repentant, the Ancestor has ended his own life and bequeathed the Estate to the player, urging that they purge it of the slavering horrors that now roam freely. The player is not alone, however: news of the player's mission and the lost treasures of the Estate has traveled far and wide, piquing the interest of steadfast warriors, devotees of the arcane, and opportunistic rogues willing to brave the Estate's dungeons.
