Curios are interactable objects that appear during expeditions . There is a chance of a good or bad event happening by using a curio. Supply items , such as a torch or a key , can be used on them to favorably alter the chances.

Different locations contain different kinds of curios, but some varieties are found throughout all types of dungeon. Each room may only contain one curio, while corridor segments can contain more than one. Unlike obstacles , curios do not prevent passage if not activated; it is thus possible to leave them be to minimize risk, especially if there is a lack of correct provision items to trigger their positive effects. Interaction Once the party enters a room or segment with a curio, it can be interacted with to activate a prompt; the curio can be investigated directly or with the use of a provision item. Curios will react differently to certain items. Normally, the use of the correct provision item will trigger a positive effect, removing the chance of negative effects occurring; however, there are a few harmless curios that do not display a prompt and are immediately searched when interacted with. Some curios grant loot upon activation. There is a fixed pool of items that is used by specific curios, but additional loot due to low light level will be calculated separately and can be dropped even by curios with very specific loot drops. The Antiquarian can cause special treasure to drop when she interacts with curios. Many curios have effects such as stress infliction, healing, bleeding , blighting , the application of buffs and debuffs or granting/removing a Quirk that will affect individual heroes . The affected hero is always the one currently selected at the moment of activation. It is advisable, upon activating risky curios, to select a hero with good resistances or one that could potentially be affected by the negative effects without endangering the expedition. Forced Interaction Heroes with certain Quirks , Diseases , or Afflictions will sometimes automatically interact with a curio without being told to do so; this is determined by the hero's traits and the curio type. Specifically, each curio has a number of types , and certain traits may force heroes to automatically interact with curios of a certain type. For example, a hero with the Necromania quirk may interact with a Dinner Cart or Mummified Remains , both having the "Body" type. Heroes forcibly interacting with a curio will never use a Supply Item, resulting in potentially very harmful consequences. In addition, certain forced interactions may cause the hero to steal any loot that would have been gained. Table of Forced Interactions The following table lists all traits that cause forced curio interactions, along with the number of affected curios in each region. Disruptive quirk/region combinations are highlighted in red. Forced Curio Interactions Footnotes ↑ The Brackish Tide Pool is arguably a positive interaction. List of Curios Shared Curios Ruins Curios Weald Curios Cove Curios Warrens Curios Courtyard Curios Farmstead Curios Probabilities of encountering each curio Note that each type of location (hallway, curio room, treasure room) uses a separate distribution. The lists below have nothing to do with the frequency of generating curio/treasure rooms or hallway curio, they just tell the probability of finding each curio given that a curio spawned in a given location. Special Curios Quest-Only Curios Some quests require the player to activate curios with special items given at the start of the quest, or retrieve special items from these curios. Unlike other curios, these can be found in either corridors or rooms (unless otherwise mentioned). Retired Curios These curios were once part of the game, but are currently unused. Miscellaneous Heirloom Chest Variants There are actually two different variants of the Heirloom Chest: the original variant, and a reskin of the now-unused Locked Strongbox. Both are identical in appearance and description but have slightly differing interactions and rewards. It is possible to distinguish the two by testing a chest with antivenom or a shovel—the success or failure of the item will be recorded and highlighted in the inventory panel when encountering a subsequent chest of the same variant. This can be done during the Ruins tutorial at the beginning of the game: the chest farthest away from the entrance can be opened with the Plague Doctor's free antivenom (which is otherwise useless, as no blighters appear in the tutorial), and from that point onwards all chests should be marked appropriately. Note that in both cases using a skeleton key will produce greater rewards, so antivenom or shovels should only be used if there is a good reason to do so.
