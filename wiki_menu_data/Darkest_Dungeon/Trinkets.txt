Trinkets Butcher's Circus Trinkets are pieces of equipment obtained while adventuring in the dungeons, earned as rewards from quests, or bought at the Nomad Wagon . Certain trinkets are earned by defeating specific enemies. Each hero is able to carry up to two different trinkets at a time. If a hero dies, their trinkets can be scavenged if the player perseveres and wins the battle. Fleeing a battle will not give such an opportunity. The trinkets confer stat bonuses and penalties when worn, and it is up to the player to use them to their full effect. Trinkets have different rarities, which are denoted in game by color and description. A trinket is given as a reward for completing each expedition , starting at Common for short Apprentice dungeons and increasing one level of rarity for each additional difficulty or length (up to Ancestral for long Champion dungeons). Boss-slaying expeditions always have a Very Rare trinket as a reward regardless of difficulty. Some trinkets can be found as a quest reward for only a specific region. These can still be bought from the Nomad Wagon . Some unique trinkets can only be found by killing specific enemies. Madmen will very rarely drop music boxes, and The Collector miniboss will sometimes drop powerful head-based trinkets (though these can also be found in Secret Rooms ). Defeating the Champion version of any of the 8 bosses (from the 4 normal regions) also awards a Trophy trinket exclusive to that boss. Ancestral trinkets, enemy trinkets (Madman, Collector, and Trophy ), and some Very Rare trinkets (particularly those from DLCs) are all unique. Once you own one, you cannot find a duplicate. If a Trophy (or a Talisman of the Flame) is lost, it will automatically reappear in the inventory the next week. If any other unique trinket is sold or discarded from the inventory, it must be found again from the same source. If you have lost (not sold/discarded) at least eight trinkets throughout your playthrough, a special quest named Shrieker's Perch will become available on the Estate map. This is a regular encounter with the Shrieker that rewards eight of your lost trinkets upon completion. Certain unique trinkets, like Ancestral trinkets, can only be recovered this way if lost. Two trinkets, the Stone of Patience and the Stone of Endurance, are currently exclusive to the PS4 and VITA versions of the game.

Your trinkets can be sorted by Class Restriction, by Rarity, or Alphabetically by name. To equip a trinket to a Hero, open that Hero's character sheet by right-clicking the picture of that hero. Then simply drag/drop the desired trinket to one of the two slots at the bottom of the screen, or manually sorted by dragging/dropping them to a new slot in the inventory. If a trinket is already in a selected slot (on the character or in the inventory), that trinket will swap places with the new one. This technique can also be used during a mission via that Inventory screen, to either equip a newly found trinket (and freeing up an inventory slot, if no equipped trinket replaces it), to unequip an unwanted trinket (assuming there is an open slot in the Inventory), or even to swap trinkets from one character to another by using both these actions. There is also an option to "unequip all trinkets" from any and all Heroes. Newly unequipped trinkets will be listed at the bottom of the inventory until re-sorted. Selling Trinkets Trinkets can be sold in the hamlet from the Trinket Inventory by holding SHIFT and clicking on them. Sell values for trinkets are as follows: Darkest Dungeon , Trophy , Crystalline , Keepsake , and Thing trinkets cannot be sold. Normal Trinkets List There are two types of Normal Trinkets; Generic and Hero specific. The player can have as many of these Trinkets in their inventory as they'd like. Generic Trinkets Generic Trinkets can be equipped by any hero. Hero Trinkets Hero Trinkets can only be equipped by the specific hero listed on the trinket. Each hero has 1-3 common/uncommon trinkets along with 1 rare/very rare trinket. Unique Trinkets The second type of Trinkets are Unique Trinkets. The player can only have one of each of the following trinkets in their inventory at once. Enemy Trinkets These Trinkets are mainly only dropped after defeating certain rare and/or powerful enemies. The only exception is The Collector's heads, which can also be found within Secret Rooms. The Ancestor's Trinkets While he was alive, the Ancestor had several powerful items that have since been scattered across the land. These items are powerful, and any hero who wields them might hold that power. However, the weight of the Ancestor's horrible actions still cling to these artifacts, and any hero holding them will feel that sinister energy upon themselves... Ancestral trinkets are usually obtained from completing long Champion-level quests and in Endless Harvest at rounds 100+. They may rarely be discovered in loot. Certain areas in the Darkest Dungeon have chests guaranteed to contain Ancestral trinkets. Five of these trinkets can only be obtained by killing the Shambler or Shuffling Horror . The "Sentimental relics from our forefathers" achievement requires the player to acquire all 14 Ancestral trinkets, which will involve needing to hunt Shamblers. Trophies Trophies are unique Trinkets that are only offered as quest rewards when defeating the highest level of a boss encounter. They mostly only offer positive bonuses with no penalties, and will also re-appear in your inventory back at the hamlet, should you lose them in a mission. Shrieker Trinkets The Radiant Update added a monster known as The Shrieker. It spawns from certain town events, one of which is called "Shrieker's Prize." Each time you complete this quest, you are awarded one of these trinkets. Crimson Court Trinkets These are special trinkets unique to the Crimson Court DLC . While they act like most Very Rare trinkets, the player can only keep one each in their inventory. All of them have effects that involve the Crimson Curse or the Courtyard in some way. All of these items can be dropped by the Fanatic , except Sculptor's Tools, which is treated the same as any Very Rare trinket. Trinket Sets The Crimson Court DLC added special Trinket Sets, two for each hero. They confer powerful bonuses to the hero equipped with them, and having both equipped at once yields an additional bonus, which is shown greyed out at the bottom. The origin dungeon for all Trinket Sets is the Courtyard and they all have the rarity Crimson Court . The Shieldbreaker Trinket Set , however, is only obtainable through her final 6th and 7th nightmare encounters and won't be dropped or given as a reward in the Courtyard. Trinkets you already have will stop dropping, so there's value in not selling the ones you don't like until you get the ones you want. Color of Madness Trinkets The Color of Madness DLC added trinkets with a new rarity, Crystalline . Each hero has their own unique crystalline trinket which can be bought from Jeweler inside the Nomad Wagon with Crystal Shards found within the Farmstead . Special These are special trinkets that have special properties that make them more unique than other trinkets. They include trinkets only found when the game begins, and the Talisman of the Flame. History When originally introduced, Tempting Goblet's rarity was Very Rare . A new subset of ancestral items were introduced in the Fiends & Frenzy update, Ancestor's trinkets. Ancestral trinkets not belonging to the Ancestor Set were later reclassified as Very Rare trinkets. The Inhuman Bondage update added a new subset of trinkets that can be found by defeating the new enemies ( Madman and The Collector ). With the full release of the game, Trophy Trinkets were introduced. With the release of the PS4 and VITA ports of the game, 5 new trinkets were added to the console versions. Two of which, the Stone of Endurance and Stone of Patience, are currently available upon starting up a new game. The other three are very rarely dropped by champion level enemies. With the release of the The Crimson Court , Trinket Sets and Sets bonuses were introduced to the game, alongside plenty of new Very Rare quality trinkets and rebalancing of old trinkets' effect and rarity. The The Color of Madness added crystalline trinkets which can be bought with shards, earned by completing the Farmstead quests. The Musketeer was also made available to all players, bringing her trinkets into the available pool. Additionally, several of the existing trinkets were rebalanced in terms of effects and rarity. Unused Trinkets There are a few unused trinkets in the game folders with unknown uses. Number of Trinkets Below are tables that shows the number of trinkets in the game depending on DLC, as well as how many are in each trinket group. Unused trinkets, backer trinkets , and the two PS4 exclusive trinkets will not be listed.
