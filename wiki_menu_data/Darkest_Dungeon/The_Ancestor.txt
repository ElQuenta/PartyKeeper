================================================================================

The Ancestor's final hours The story of Darkest Dungeon is narrated by the Ancestor , a mysterious and seemingly omnipresent character who accompanies the player in their adventures. Along the player's journey the Ancestor will gradually reveal, through his foreboding comments, the history of the Hamlet and the various monsters infesting the area, as well as his own role in the events leading up to the player character's arrival. All unlocked narrations concerning the plot are available by consulting the Ancestor's Memoirs , a building found in the central square of the Hamlet .

After a lifetime of debauchery and arcane pursuits, he excavated an unspeakable, ancient horror far below the foundations of his mansion. This discovery shocked him into realising the depths of his crimes and recklessness, only too late for him to personally make amends. In a final letter sent to the player, he bequeaths them the Estate and urges them to reclaim it from the burgeoning corruption that now plagues it due to his actions. He then ends his own life. Even in death, however, the Ancestor accompanies and guides the player as the omnipresent Narrator. Narrator's responses The Narrator reacts differently to many events and actions of the player. He will comment on a grand variety of events and parts of the game including the sparse cinematics , positive and negative dungeon interactions , critical hits , hero recruitment and death, as well as various interactions within the Hamlet and more.
